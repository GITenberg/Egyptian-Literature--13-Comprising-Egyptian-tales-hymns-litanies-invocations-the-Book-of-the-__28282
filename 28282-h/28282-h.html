<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wonders of Egyptian arch√¶ology are the latest and
most precious harvest of scholars and explorers. From
Belzoni to Flinders Petrie there has been a succession
of discoveries in the valley of the Nile with which it is hard
for ordinary students to keep pace. Our knowledge of
Egyptian life to-day is far clearer and more complete than
Bentley's or Porson's acquaintance with the antiquities of
Greece and Rome, and we have far more complete access to the
treasures of Egyptian literature than Dante or Thomas
Aquinas had to the remains of Attic poets and mystics. We
know exactly how an Egyptian of the twelfth dynasty dressed;
what was the position of women in Egypt; and what uniform
was worn by the Egyptian soldiers who took part in the campaign
against Khitasis. We can see Rameses II riding in
his war-chariot; we know the very names of the horses by
whose side his tame lion is running and thirsting for the blood
of his master's foes. We know all about the domestic animals,
the funeral customs, the trades, the gods, the agriculture of
the Nile valley thirty centuries ago. We see the whole many-sided
civilization portrayed in the brightest colors in the
poetry, the books of ritual, the hieratic inscriptions, the tablets,
papyri, and hieroglyphics which day by day come to light in
exhaustless abundance from the mounds and ruins of that
fertile plain that stretches from Thebes to the Mareotic lake.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For instance, we can learn exact particulars about the mode
in which Rameses II made war, from the poem of Penta-Our,
a Theban writer of the fourteenth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It is only by
a figure of speech that this poem can be called an epic; it is
rather a historical narrative couched in terms of poetic exaggeration
with the object of flattering the royal vanity of
Pharaoh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The campaign in which Rameses then engaged was directed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against Kadesh, a city built on an island in the Orontes. It
is, according to Penta-Our, inhabited by a people known as
Khita, whose spies are brought into the tent of Rameses and
questioned as to the whereabouts of the King of Kadesh. The
spies are forced by blows to answer, and they tell the Egyptian
monarch that the King of the Khita <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis powerful with many
soldiers, and with chariot soldiers, and with their harness, as
many as the sand of the seashore, and they are ready to fight
behind Kadesh.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The King is very angry; for he had been deceived by false
news to the effect that his enemy had fled in terror to Khilibu.
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe fault is great,‚Äù</span> he cries, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the governors of the land
and the vassal princes of Pharaoh have committed, in neglecting
to watch the movements of the Khita.‚Äù</span> He sends to bring
back the legions he had sent away, and meanwhile the approach
of the enemy is announced. The camp of Rameses is
surprised by the Asiatics; many foot-soldiers are killed before
they can seize their weapons, but a faithful band rallies in
front of the royal quarters. Suddenly a cry is heard; Rameses
has quickly put on his armor, seized his lance, ordered his
war lion to be loosed, and dashed into the fight. Pharaoh with
his master of the horse, Menni, is soon hemmed in by foes.
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy Lord, O generous King!‚Äù</span> cries Menni, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEgypt's great
protector in the day of battle! behold we stand alone in the
midst of the enemy, for the archers and the chariots have left
us. Let us return, that our lives may be saved. Save us, O
my Lord, Rameses Miamun!‚Äù</span> Then Rameses called upon
Amen, his god, and under his protection charged the enemy,
and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhis hand devoured them in the space of an instant.‚Äù</span> Five
times he rushed upon them, and five times they repulsed him.
The sixth time he breaks their ranks and regains his own
lines. Then the legions of Ptah, which had returned to the
camp, join the battle, and the Asiatics are routed. The first
care of Rameses is to refresh his brave horses, Victory-in-Thebes
and Maut-is-Satisfied. Neither they nor Rameses and
his lion are wounded, though all stained with blood and dust,
while the head-plumes of the team are torn and tattered and
their caparison broken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is a brief account of the main incident in this Egyptian
epic, which is written with life-like detail and animation. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
war concludes with a treaty, and the marriage of Rameses with
the daughter of the King of Kadesh, so that henceforth <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
people of Egypt were of one mind with the princes of Khita,
which had not been the case since the god RƒÅ.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Egyptians have always been deeply impressed by the
fact of human mortality, and much of their religious belief and
religious ritual is taken up with the rites of burial, and detailed
doctrines as to the experience of the soul after parting
from the body. Their elaborate embalming of the dead
springs from the desire to keep the mortal tenement prepared
for the soul's return to it. In their Book of the Dead
is a full series of prayers, songs, and incantations to be employed
at funerals, and by the individual in his journey beyond
the tomb. The funeral procession was a very noisy company;
lamentations were heard through its whole length, but the
burden of the hymns was always, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTo the West.‚Äù</span> This was
enlarged upon, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTo the West, the dwelling of Osiris; O Chief,
as thou goest to the West, the Gods themselves lament, as thou
goest to the West.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Osiris is the judge who weighs the souls, and allots them
happiness or misery, according to their deserts. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe Book
of the Dead‚Äù</span> is interesting because it teaches how clearly and
dogmatically the solemn and precise Egyptian stated his views
and held his convictions concerning the unknown country.
Four parts of man, it was said, survive after death, namely,
the soul, the spirit, the shadow, and the double. The double
remains in the tomb, and only leaves it in search of food.
Sometimes it feels its loneliness and avenges itself upon near
relations who have forsaken it. But the soul hurries to the
bar of Osiris, where Thoth weighs the heart in the scales, and
the innocent are admitted into the Field of Beans, a realm
of fertility, where wheat grows seven cubits high. Immortality
is spent in feasting, singing, conversation, and games.
But the whole of this wonderful book is well worth studying.
It shows how what Addison calls <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthis longing after immortality‚Äù</span>
led an ancient and deeply religious people to
attempt in their burial rites to rob even the grave of its terrors,
and conjured up out of the shadows of the tomb a clear and
distinct vision of future life, wherein man in his complete individuality
survived to all eternity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the most important results of recent Egyptian
exploration must be reckoned the discovery of the tablets of
Tell Amarna. Tell Amarna is a village in Upper Egypt, and
in a pit at the foot of the mountain, at the base of which it
stands, were discovered hundreds of these relics, which have
since been distributed among the museums of London, Berlin,
and Gizeh. The writing on these tablets is cuneiform, and
the matter is of profound historic importance, illustrating, as
it does, the relations between Egypt and western Asia in the
fifteenth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> While the existence of these tablets
proves that cuneiform writing was common to Palestine and
Syria as well as the Euphrates Valley, yet curiously enough the
manuscripts of Tell Amarna are different from any of the
same kind that have been found elsewhere, and the language
resembles somewhat the Hebrew of the Old Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While most of these tablets are letters and despatches from
friendly powers in Syria, and from vassal princes in Palestine,
others contain interesting legends. The letters are addressed
to the Pharaohs known as Amenophis III and Amenophis IV,
who reigned in the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Egyptians employed what practically were three alphabets‚Äîthe
hieroglyphic, the hieratic, and the demotic. The
hieroglyph is a symbol, denoting something without letters or
syllables; as, pictures of a bee stand for king. The hieratic
handwriting was a transition from symbols to primitive
letters; the papyrus reed, cut in slices and gummed together,
was used as paper for this writing, much of which is very
beautifully executed in black and red inks. These papyri are
constantly being discovered, but perhaps the earliest <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfind‚Äù</span>
of importance was that at Thebes in 1846, when a number of
literary compositions were brought to light which must have
been executed during the twelfth dynasty, about twenty-five
centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Egyptian Tales are works written in a lighter vein than
the literature we have already described. They will be read
with delight, and none the less so because they show that the
Egyptians, who are the Chinese of the Mediterranean, possess
that saving quality in literary and political life, namely, a
sense of humor.

hands of Ba-neb-Tattu. My forearms are the forearms of
Neith, the Lady of Sais. My backbone is the backbone of Suti.
My phallus is the phallus of Osiris. My reins are the reins of
the Lords of Kher-ƒÅba. My chest is the chest of the Mighty
one of Terror. My belly and back are the belly and back of
Sekhet. My buttocks are the buttocks of the Eye of Horus.
My hips and legs are the hips and legs of Nut. My feet are the
feet of Ptah. [My fingers] and my leg-bones are the [fingers
and] leg-bones of the Living Gods. There is no member of
my body which is not the member of some god. The god
Thoth shieldeth my body altogether, and I am RƒÅ day by day.
I shall not be dragged back by my arms, and none shall lay
violent hold upon my hands. And shall do me hurt neither
men, nor gods, nor the sainted dead, nor those who have
perished, nor any one of those of ancient times, nor any mortal,
nor any human being. I am he who cometh forth, advancing,
whose name is unknown. I am Yesterday, and Seer of millions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of years is my name. I pass along, I pass along the paths of
the divine celestial judges. I am the lord of eternity, and I
decree and I judge like the god Khepera. I am the lord of the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ureret</span></span> crown. I am he who dwelleth in the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Utchat</span></span> [and in the
Egg, in the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Utchat</span></span> and in the Egg, and it is given unto
me to live [with] them. I am he that dwelleth in the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Utchat</span></span> when it
closeth, and I exist by the strength thereof. I come forth and
I shine; I enter in and I come to life. I am in the

my seat is upon my throne, and I sit in the abode of splendor(?)
before it. I am Horus and (I) traverse millions of years. I
have given the decree [for the stablishing of] my throne and I
am the ruler thereof; and in very truth, my mouth keepeth an
even balance both in speech and in silence. In very truth, my
forms are inverted. I am Un-nefer, from one season even unto
another, and what I have is within me; [I am] the only One,
who proceedeth from an only One who goeth round about in
his course. I am he who dwelleth in the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Utchat</span></span>, no evil
thing of any form or kind shall spring up against me, and no baleful
object, and no harmful thing, and no disastrous thing shall
happen unto me. I open the door in heaven, I govern my
throne, and I open up [the way] for the births [which take
place] on this day. I am (?) the child who marcheth along the
road of Yesterday. [I am] To-day for untold nations and
peoples. I am he who protecteth you for millions of years, and
whether ye be denizens of the heavens, or of the earth, or of
the south, or of the north, or of the east, or of the west, the fear
of me is in your bodies. I am he whose being has been moulded
in his eye, and I shall not die again. My moment is in your
bodies, but my forms are in my place of habitation. I am
he who cannot be known, but the Red Ones have their faces
directed toward me. I am the unveiled one. The season
wherein [the god] created the heavens for me and enlarged
the bounds of the earth and made great the progeny thereof
cannot be found out; but they fail and are not united [again].
My name setteth itself apart from all things [and from] the
great evil [which is in] the mouths [of men] by reason of the
speech which I address unto you. I am he who riseth and
shineth, the wall which cometh out of a wall, an only One who
proceedeth from an only One. There is never a day that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
passeth without the things which appertain unto him being
therein; passing, passing, passing, passing. Verily I say unto
thee, I am the Sprout which cometh forth from Nu, and my
Mother is Nut. Hail, O my Creator, I am he who hath no
power to walk, the great Knot who is within yesterday. The
might of my strength is within my hand. I myself am not
known, but I am he who knoweth thee. I cannot be held with
the hand, but I am he who can hold thee in his hand. Hail, O
Egg! Hail, O Egg! I am Horus who lives for millions of years,
whose flame shineth upon you and bringeth your hearts to
me. I have the command of my throne and I advance at this
season, I have opened a path, and I have delivered myself from
all evil things. I am the dog-headed ape of gold three palms
and two fingers [high], which hath neither arms nor legs and
dwelleth in Het-ka-Ptah (Memphis), and I go forth as goeth
forth the dog-headed ape that dwelleth in Het-ka-Ptah.‚Äù</span>

Aukert (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, underworld) which hidest thy companion who is
in thee, thou creator of forms of existence like the god Khepera,
grant thou that Nebseni, the scribe and designer to the temples
of the South and of the North, may come forth to see the Disk,
and that his journeyings forth(?) may be in the presence of
the great god, that is to say, Shu, who dwelleth in everlastingness.
Let me journey on in peace; let me pass over the sky;
let me adore the radiance of the splendor [which is in] my
sight; let me soar like a bird to see the companies(?) of the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khu</span></span>s in the presence of RƒÅ day by day, who vivifieth

carriest away the shades of the dead and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khu</span></span>s from

such as is made for the favored ones [of the god],

and both my hands are clean to adore him. I have gathered
together [all my members], I have gathered together [all my

and mine eye maketh me to walk thereon in my footsteps.
I am the child of yesterday, and the Akeru gods of the earth

Aba-ƒÅƒÅiu who will walk behind me, and my members shall

<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am one of those worms(?) which the eye of the Lord,

than those who dwelt with the divine <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khu</span></span>, and who had

his divine father Osiris spake unto him in years [gone by] on

The gods, each and all of them, who are the warders of the
shrine of the Lord, the only One, have fallen before my words.
Hail! He that is exalted upon his tomb is on my side, and
he hath bound [upon my head] the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nemmes</span></span> crown, by the
decree of the double Lion-god on my behalf, and the god Auhet
hath prepared a way for me. I, even I, am exalted in my
tomb, and the double Lion-god hath bound the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nemmes</span></span> crown
upon my [head], and he hath also given unto me the double
hairy covering of my head. He hath stablished my heart
through his own backbone, he hath stablished my heart
through his own great and exceeding strength, and I shall not
fall through Shu. I make my peace with the beautiful divine
Brother, the lord of the two ur√¶i, adored be he! I, even I,
am he who knoweth the roads through the sky, and the wind
thereof is in my body. The bull which striketh terror [into
men] shall not drive me back, and I shall pass on to the place
where lieth the shipwrecked mariner on the border of the Sekhet-neheh
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Field of illimitable time), and I shall journey
on to the night and sorrow of the regions of Amenti. O Osiris,
I shall come each day into the House of the double Lion-god,
and I shall come forth therefrom into the House of Isis, the
divine lady. I shall behold sacred things which are hidden,
and I shall be led on to the secret and holy things, even as
they have granted unto me to see the birth of the Great God.
Horus hath made me to be a spiritual body through his soul,
[and I see what is therein. If I speak near the mighty ones
of Shu they repulse my opportunity. I am the guardian and
I] take possession of the things which Horus had from Osiris
in the underworld. I, even I, am Horus who dwelleth in the
divine <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khu</span></span>. [I] have gained power over his crown, I have
gained power over his radiance, and I have travelled over the
remote, illimitable parts of heaven. Horus is upon his throne,
Horus is upon his royal seat. My face is like unto that of the
divine hawk, my strength is like unto that of the divine hawk,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and I am one who hath been fully equipped by his divine Lord.
I shall come forth to Tattu, I shall see Osiris, I shall pay
homage to him on the right hand and on the left, I shall pay
homage unto Nut, and she shall look upon me, and the gods
shall look upon me, together with the Eye of Horus who is
without sight(?). They (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the gods) shall make their arms
to come forth unto me. I rise up [as] a divine Power, and
[I] repulse him that would subject me to restraint. They open
unto me the holy paths, they see my form, and they hear that
which I speak. [Down] upon your faces, ye gods of the Tuat
(underworld), who would resist me with your faces and oppose
me with your powers, who lead along the stars which
never rest, and who make the holy paths unto the Hemati
abode [where is] the Lord of the exceedingly mighty and terrible
Soul. Horus hath commanded that ye lift up your faces
so that I may look upon you. I have risen up like the divine
hawk, and Horus hath made for me a spiritual body, through
his own soul, to take possession of that which belongeth to
Osiris in the Tuat (underworld). I have bound up the gods
with divine tresses, and I have travelled on to those who ward
their Chambers, and who were on both sides of me. I have
made my roads and I have journeyed on and have reached
those divine beings who inhabit their secret dwellings, and
who are warders of the Temple of Osiris. I have spoken unto
them with strength, and have made them to know the most
mighty power of him that is provided with two horns [to
fight] against Suti; and I make them to know concerning him
that hath taken possession of the divine food, and who is provided
with the Might of Tem. May the gods of the underworld
[order] a prosperous journey for me! O ye gods who
inhabit your secret dwellings, and who are warders of the Temple
of Osiris, and whose numbers are great and multitudinous,
grant ye that I may come unto you. I have bound up and I
have gathered together the powers of Kesemu-enenet,‚Äù</span> or
(as others say), <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúKesemiu-enenet; and I have made holy the
Powers of the paths of those who watch and ward the roads
of the horizon, and who are the guardians of the horizon of
Hemati which is in heaven. I have stablished habitations for
Osiris, I have made the ways holy for him, I have done that
which hath been commanded, I have come forth to Tattu, I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have seen Osiris, I have spoken unto him concerning the matters
of his first-born son whom he loveth and concerning the
wounding of the heart of Suti, and I have seen the divine one
who is without life. Yea, I have made them to know concerning
the counsels of the gods which Horus carried out
while his father Osiris was not [with him]. Hail, Lord, thou
most mighty and terrible Soul! Verily, I, even I, have come,
look thou upon me, and do thou make me to be exalted. I
have made my way through the Tuat (underworld), and I have
opened up the paths which belong to heaven and also those
which belong to earth, and I have suffered no opposition
therein. Exalted [be thou] upon thy throne, O Osiris! Thou
hast heard fair things, O Osiris! Thy strength is vigorous,
O Osiris. Thy head is fastened unto thee, O Osiris. Thy
brow is stablished, O Osiris. Thy heart is glad, [O Osiris].
Thy speech(?) is stablished, [O Osiris], and thy princes rejoice.
Thou art stablished like the Bull of Amentet. Thy son
Horus hath risen like the sun upon thy throne, and all life is
with him. Millions of years minister unto him, and millions
of years hold him in fear; the company of the gods are his
servants, and the company of the gods hold him in fear. The
god Tem, the Governor and only One of the gods, hath spoken
[these things], and his word passeth not away. Horus is
both the divine food and the sacrifice. [He] hath passed on(?)
to gather together [the members of] his divine father; Horus
is [his] deliverer, Horus is [his] deliverer. Horus hath
sprung from the water of his divine father and [from his] decay.
He hath become the Governor of Egypt. The gods labor
for him, and they toil for him for millions of years; and he
hath made to live millions of years through his Eye, the only
One of its Lord (or Neb-s), Nebt-er-tcher.‚Äù</span>

wheresoever I please. My head is like unto that of RƒÅ, and
[when my members are] gathered together [I am] like unto
Tem; the four [sides of the domain] of RƒÅ, and the width of
the earth four times. I come forth. My tongue is like unto
that of Ptah and my throne is like unto that of the goddess
Hathor, and I make mention of the words of Tem, my father,
with my mouth. He it is who constraineth the handmaid, the
wife of Seb, and before him are bowed [all] heads, and there
is fear of him. Hymns of praise are repeated for [me] by reason
of [my] mighty acts, and I am decreed to be the divine Heir
of Seb, the lord of the earth and to be the protector therein.
The god Seb refresheth me, and he maketh his risings to be
mine. Those who dwell in Annu bow down their heads unto
me, for I am their lord and I am their bull. I am more powerful

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opened the ways of the two eyes [which are] in heaven. Set

and he hath delivered the interior of the body of Horus from
the gods of Akert. Behold me now, for I make this mighty
boat to travel over the Lake of Hetep, and I brought it away
with might from the palace of Shu; the domain of his stars
groweth young and reneweth its former strength. I have
brought the boat into the lakes thereof so that I may come
forth into the cities thereof, and I have sailed into their divine
city Hetep. And behold, it is because I, even I, am at peace
with his seasons, and with his guidance, and with his territory,
and with the company of the gods who are his first-born.
He maketh the two divine fighters (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Horus and Set)
to be at peace with those who watch over the living ones
whom he hath created in fair form, and he bringeth peace [with

is linked unto the pleasant things of RƒÅ. He is the divider
of years, he is hidden of mouth, his mouth is silent, that which
he uttereth is secret, he fulfilleth eternity and taketh possession
of everlastingness of existence as Hetep, the lord Hetep. The
god Horus maketh himself to be strong like unto the Hawk
which is one thousand cubits in length and two thousand
[cubits in width] in life; he hath equipments with him, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he journeyeth on and cometh where the seat of his heart
wisheth in the Pools thereof and in the cities thereof. He was
begotten in the birth-chamber of the god of the city, he hath
offerings [made unto him] of the food of the god of the city,
he performeth that which it is meet to do therein, and the
union thereof, in the matter of everything of the birth-chamber
of the divine city. When [he] setteth in life like crystal
he performeth everything therein, and these things are like
unto the things which are done in the Lake of double Fire,
wherein there is none that rejoiceth, and wherein are all manner
of evil things. The god Hetep goeth in, and cometh out,
and goeth backward [in] that Field which gathereth together
all manner of things for the birth-chamber of the god of the
city. When he setteth in life like crystal he performeth all
manner of things therein which are like unto the things which
are done in the Lake of double Fire, wherein there is none
that rejoiceth, and wherein are no evil things whatsoever.
[Let me] live with the god Hetep, clothed and not despoiled

I come forth, and may he bring my power to me there, and

that supreme moment when the paddles of thine enemies move
with thee! The Osiris Nu, the overseer of the palace, the
chancellor-in-chief, triumphant, cometh with the ordering of
right and truth, for there is an iron firmament in Amentet
which the fiend Apep hath broken through with his storms
before the double Lion-god, and this will the Osiris Nu set in
order; O hearken ye, ye who dwell upon the top of the throne
of majesty. The Osiris Nu shall come in among thy divine
sovereign chiefs, and RƒÅ shall deliver him from Apep each day
so that he may not come nigh unto him, and he shall make himself
vigilant. The Osiris Nu shall have power over the things
which are written, he shall receive sepulchral meals, and the

prepared for him. The Osiris Nu maketh right and truth to
go round about the bows in the Great Boat, and hath triumph
among the divine sovereign chiefs, and he establisheth [it]

to rest. The god RƒÅ exalteth him by reason of what he hath
done, and he causeth him to make of none effect the whirlwind
and the storm; he looketh upon his splendors, and he stablisheth
his oars, and the boat saileth round about in heaven, rising like
the sun in the darkness. Thoth, the mighty one, leadeth the
Osiris Nu within his eye, and he sitteth [upon his] thigh[s]
in the mighty boat of Khepera; he cometh into being, and the
things which he saith come to pass. The Osiris Nu advanceth,
and he journeyeth round about heaven unto Amentet, the fiery
deities stand up before him, and the god Shu rejoiceth exceedingly,
and they take in their hands the bows [of the boat]
of RƒÅ along with his divine mariners. RƒÅ goeth round about
and he looketh upon Osiris. The Osiris Nu is at peace, the
Osiris Nu is at peace. He hath not been driven back, the
flame of thy moment hath not been taken away from him,
[O RƒÅ,] the whirlwind and storm of thy mouth have not come
forth against him, he hath not journeyed upon the path of the
crocodile‚Äîfor he abominateth the crocodile‚Äîand it hath not
drawn nigh unto him. The Osiris Nu embarked in thy boat,
O RƒÅ, he is furnished with thy throne, and he receiveth thy

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold now, O ye luminaries in Annu (Heliopolis), ye
people in Kher-ƒÅba, the god hath been born; his cordage(?)
hath been completed, and the instrument wherewith he
maketh his way he hath grasped firmly; and the Osiris Nu is
strong with them to direct the implement of the gods. The
Osiris Nu hath delivered the boat of the sun therewith ...
and he cometh forth into heaven. The Osiris Nu sailed round
about in heaven, he travelleth therein unto Nut, he journeyeth
along with RƒÅ, and he voyageth therein in the form of apes;
[he] turneth back the water-flood which is over the Thigh of
the goddess Nut at the staircase of the god Sebaku. The hearts
of Seb and Nut are glad and repeat the name which is new.
Un-neferu reneweth [his] youth, RƒÅ is in his splendors of
light, Unti hath his speech, and lo, the god of the Inundation
is Prince among the gods. The taste of sweetness hath forced
a way into the heart of the destitute one, and the lord of thy
outcries hath been done away with, and the oars(?) of the
company of the gods are in vigorous motion. Adored be thou,
O divine Soul, who art endowed more than the gods of the
South and North [in] their splendors! Behold, grant thou
that the Osiris Nu may be great in heaven even as thou art
great among the gods; deliver thou him from every evil and
murderous thing which may be wrought upon him by the
Fiend, and fortify thou his heart. Grant thou, moreover, that
the Osiris Nu may be stronger than all the gods, all the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khu</span></span>s,
and all the dead. The Osiris Nu is strong and is the lord of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
powers. The Osiris Nu is the lord of right and truth
which the goddess Uatchit worketh. The strength which protects
the Osiris Nu is the strength which protects the god RƒÅ in
heaven. O god RƒÅ, grant thou that the Osiris Nu may travel
on in thy boat in peace, and do thou prepare a road whereon
[thy] boat may journey onward; for the force which protecteth
Osiris is the force which protecteth thee. The Osiris
Nu driveth back the Crocodile from RƒÅ day by day. The
Osiris Nu cometh even as doth Horus in the splendors(?) of
the horizon of heaven, and he directeth RƒÅ through the mansions
of the sky; the gods rejoice greatly when the Osiris Nu
repulseth the Crocodile. The Osiris Nu hath the amulet(?)
of the god, and the cloud of Nebt shall not come nigh unto
him, and the divine guardians of the mansions of the sky shall
not destroy him. The Osiris Nu is a divine being whose face
is hidden, and he dwelleth within the Great House [as] the
chief of the Shrine of the god. The Osiris Nu carrieth the
words of the gods to RƒÅ, and he cometh and maketh supplication
unto the divine lord with the words of his message. The
Osiris Nu is strong of heart, and he maketh his offering at the
moment among those who perform the ceremonies of sacrifice.‚Äù</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was once in the time of King Men-kheper-ra a
revolt of the servants of his Majesty who were in
Joppa; and his Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet Tahutia go with
his footmen and destroy this wicked Foe in Joppa.‚Äù</span> And
he called one of his followers, and said moreover, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHide thou
my great cane, which works wonders, in the baggage of
Tahutia that my power may go with him.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now when Tahutia came near to Joppa, with all the footmen
of Pharaoh, he sent unto the Foe in Joppa, and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold now his Majesty, King Men-kheper-ra, has sent all
this great army against thee; but what is that if my heart is
as thy heart? Do thou come, and let us talk in the field, and
see each other face to face.‚Äù</span> So Tahutia came with certain
of his men; and the Foe in Joppa came likewise, but his
charioteer that was with him was true of heart unto the
King of Egypt. And they spoke with one another in his
great tent, which Tahutia had placed far off from the soldiers.
But Tahutia had made ready 200 sacks, with cords and fetters,
and had made a great sack of skins with bronze fetters, and
many baskets: and they were in his tent, the sacks and the
baskets, and he had placed them as the forage for the horses
is put in baskets. For while the Foe in Joppa drank with
Tahutia, the people who were with him drank with the footmen
of Pharaoh, and made merry with them. And when
their bout of drinking was past, Tahutia said to the Foe in
Joppa, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIf it please thee, while I remain with the women and
children of thy own city, let one bring of my people with
their horses, that they may give them provender, or let one
of the Apuro run to fetch them.‚Äù</span> So they came, and hobbled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their horses, and gave them provender, and one found the
great cane of Men-kheper-ra (Tahutmes III), and came to
tell of it to Tahutia. And thereupon the Foe in Joppa said
to Tahutia: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy heart is set on examining the great cane
of Men-kheper-ra, which is named <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äò... tautnefer.‚Äô</span> By the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ka</span></span> of the King Men-kheper-ra it will be in thy hands
to-day; now do thou well and bring thou it to me.‚Äù</span> And Tahutia did
thus, and he brought the cane of King Men-kheper-ra. And
he laid hold on the Foe in Joppa by his garment, and he arose
and stood up, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLook on me, O Foe in Joppa; here
is the great cane of King Men-kheper-ra, the terrible lion, the
son of Sekhet, to whom Amen his father gives power and
strength.‚Äù</span> And he raised his hand and struck the forehead
of the Foe in Joppa, and he fell helpless before him. He put
him in the sack of skins and he bound with gyves the hands
of the Foe in Joppa, and put on his feet the fetters with four
rings. And he made them bring the 200 sacks which he had
cleaned, and made to enter into them 200 soldiers, and filled
the hollows with cords and fetters of wood, he sealed them
with a seal, and added to them their rope-nets and the poles
to bear them. And he put every strong footman to bear them,
in all 600 men, and said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhen you come into the
town you shall open your burdens, you shall seize on all the
inhabitants of the town, and you shall quickly put fetters upon
them.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then one went out and said unto the charioteer of the Foe
in Joppa, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThy master is fallen; go, say to thy mistress, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòA
pleasant message! For Sutekh has given Tahutia to us, with
his wife and his children; behold the beginning of their tribute,‚Äô</span>
that she may comprehend the two hundred sacks, which are
full of men and cords and fetters.‚Äù</span> So he went before them
to please the heart of his mistress, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWe have laid hands
on Tahutia.‚Äù</span> Then the gates of the city were opened before
the footmen: they entered the city, they opened their burdens,
they laid hands on them of the city, both small and great, they
put on them the cords and fetters quickly; the power of
Pharaoh seized upon that city. After he had rested Tahutia
sent a message to Egypt to the King Men-kheper-ra his lord,
saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBe pleased, for Amen thy good father has given
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to thee the Foe in Joppa, together with all his people, likewise
also his city. Send, therefore, people to take them as captives
that thou mayest fill the house of thy father Amen Ra, king
of the gods, with men-servants and maid-servants, and that
they may be overthrown beneath thy feet for ever and ever.‚Äù</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There once was a king to whom no son was born; and his
heart was grieved, and he prayed for himself unto the gods
around him for a child. They decreed that one should be born
to him. And his wife, after her time was fulfilled, brought forth
a son. Then came the Hathors to decree for him a destiny; they
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHis death is to be by the crocodile, or by the serpent, or
by the dog.‚Äù</span> Then the people who stood by heard this, and they
went to tell it to his Majesty. Then his Majesty's heart sickened
very greatly. And his Majesty caused a house to be built
upon the desert; it was furnished with people and with all good
things of the royal house, that the child should not go abroad.
And when the child was grown, he went up upon the roof, and
he saw a dog; it was following a man who was walking on the
road. He spoke to his page, who was with him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhat is
this that walks behind the man who is coming along the
road?‚Äù</span> He answered him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is a dog.‚Äù</span> The child said
to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet there be brought to me one like it.‚Äù</span> The page
went to repeat it to his Majesty. And his Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet
there be brought to him a little pet dog, lest his heart be sad.‚Äù</span>
And behold they brought to him the dog.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then when the days increased after this, and when the child
became grown in all his limbs, he sent a message to his father
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCome, wherefore am I kept here? Inasmuch as I
am fated to three evil fates, let me follow my desire. Let
God do what is in his heart.‚Äù</span> They agreed to all he said, and
gave him all sorts of arms, and also his dog to follow him,
and they took him to the east country, and said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold,
go thou whither thou wilt.‚Äù</span> His dog was with him,
and he went northward, following his heart in the desert, while
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he lived on all the best of the game of the desert. He went
to the chief of Naharaina.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And behold there had not been any born to the chief of
Naharaina, except one daughter. Behold, there had been
built for her a house; its seventy windows were seventy cubits
from the ground. And the chief caused to be brought all the
sons of the chiefs of the land of Khalu, and said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe
who reaches the window of my daughter, she shall be to him
for a wife.‚Äù</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And many days after these things, as they were in their
daily task, the youth rode by the place where they were. They
took the youth to their house, they bathed him, they gave
provender to his horses, they brought all kinds of things for
the youth, they perfumed him, they anointed his feet, they gave
him portions of their own food; and they spake to him,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhence comest thou, goodly youth?‚Äù</span> He said to them,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am son of an officer of the land of Egypt; my mother is
dead, and my father has taken another wife. And when she
bore children, she grew to hate me, and I have come as a
fugitive from before her.‚Äù</span> And they embraced him, and
kissed him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And after many days were passed, he said to the youths,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhat is it that ye do here?‚Äù</span> And they said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWe
spend our time in this: we climb up, and he who shall reach
the window of the daughter of the chief of Naharaina, to him
will be given her to wife.‚Äù</span> He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIf it please you,
let me behold the matter, that I may come to climb with you.‚Äù</span>
They went to climb, as was their daily wont: and the youth
stood afar off to behold; and the face of the daughter of the
chief of Naharaina was turned to them. And another day the
sons came to climb, and the youth came to climb with the
sons of the chiefs. He climbed, and he reached the window
of the daughter of the chief of Naharaina. She kissed him,
she embraced him in all his limbs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And one went to rejoice the heart of her father, and said
to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOne of the people has reached the window of thy
daughter.‚Äù</span> And the prince inquired of the messenger, saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe son of which of the princes is it?‚Äù</span> And he replied
to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt is the son of an officer, who has come as a fugitive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the land of Egypt, fleeing from before his stepmother when
she had children.‚Äù</span> Then the chief of Naharaina was exceeding
angry; and he said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúShall I indeed give my daughter
to the Egyptian fugitive? Let him go back whence he came.‚Äù</span>
And one came to tell the youth, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGo back to the place thou
camest from.‚Äù</span> But the maiden seized his hand; she swore
an oath by God, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBy the being of Ra Harakhti, if one
takes him from me, I will not eat, I will not drink, I shall die
in that same hour.‚Äù</span> The messenger went to tell unto her
father all that she said. Then the prince sent men to slay the
youth, while he was in his house. But the maiden said:
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBy the being of Ra, if one slay him I shall be dead ere the
sun goeth down. I will not pass an hour of life if I am parted
from him.‚Äù</span> And one went to tell her father. Then the prince
made them bring the youth with the maiden. The youth was
seized with fear when he came before the prince. But he embraced
him, he kissed him all over, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOh, tell me
who thou art; behold, thou art to me as a son.‚Äù</span> He said to
him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am a son of an officer of the land of Egypt; my
mother died, my father took to him a second wife; she came
to hate me, and I fled a fugitive from before her.‚Äù</span> He then
gave to him his daughter to wife; he gave also to him a house,
and serfs, and fields, also cattle and all manner of good things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But after the days of these things were passed, the youth
said to his wife, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am doomed to three fates‚Äîa crocodile, a
serpent, and a dog.‚Äù</span> She said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet one kill the dog
which belongs to thee.‚Äù</span> He replied to her, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am not going
to kill my dog, which I have brought up from when it was
small.‚Äù</span> And she feared greatly for her husband, and would
not let him go alone abroad.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And one went with the youth toward the land of Egypt,
to travel in that country. Behold the crocodile of the river,
he came out by the town in which the youth was. And in that
town was a mighty man. And the mighty man would not
suffer the crocodile to escape. And when the crocodile was
bound, the mighty man went out and walked abroad. And
when the sun rose the mighty man went back to the house;
and he did so every day, during two months of days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now when the days passed after this, the youth sat making
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a good day in his house. And when the evening came he lay
down on his bed, sleep seized upon his limbs; and his wife
filled a bowl of milk, and placed it by his side. Then came
out a serpent from his hole, to bite the youth; behold his wife
was sitting by him, she lay not down. Thereupon the servants
gave milk to the serpent, and he drank, and was drunk, and
lay upside down. Then his wife made it to perish with the
blows of her dagger. And they woke her husband, who was
astonished; and she said unto him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold thy God has
given one of thy dooms into thy hand; he will also give thee
the others.‚Äù</span> And he sacrificed to God, adoring him, and
praising his spirits from day to day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when the days were passed after these things, the youth
went to walk in the fields of his domain. He went not alone,
behold his dog was following him. And his dog ran aside
after the wild game, and he followed the dog. He came to
the river, and entered the river behind his dog. Then came
out the crocodile, and took him to the place where the mighty
man was. And the crocodile said to the youth, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am thy
doom, following after thee....‚Äù</span>

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">Anpu And Bata</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Once there were two brethren, of one mother and one father;
Anpu was the name of the elder, and Bata was the name of the
younger. Now, as for Anpu he had a house, and he had a wife.
But his little brother was to him as it were a son; he it was who
made for him his clothes; he it was who followed behind his
oxen to the fields; he it was who did the ploughing; he it was
who harvested the corn; he it was who did for him all the matters
that were in the field. Behold, his younger brother grew
to be an excellent worker, there was not his equal in the whole
land; behold, the spirit of a god was in him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now after this the younger brother followed his oxen in his
daily manner; and every evening he turned again to the
house, laden with all the herbs of the field, with milk and with
wood, and with all things of the field. And he put them down
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before his elder brother, who was sitting with his wife; and
he drank and ate, and he lay down in his stable with the cattle.
And at the dawn of day he took bread which he had
baked, and laid it before his elder brother; and he took with
him his bread to the field, and he drave his cattle to pasture in
the fields. And as he walked behind his cattle, they said to
him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGood is the herbage which is in that place‚Äù</span>; and he
listened to all that they said, and he took them to the good
place which they desired. And the cattle which were before
him became exceeding excellent, and they multiplied greatly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now at the time of ploughing his elder brother said unto
him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet us make ready for ourselves a goodly yoke of oxen
for ploughing, for the land has come out from the water, it
is fit for ploughing. Moreover, do thou come to the field
with corn, for we will begin the ploughing in the morrow
morning.‚Äù</span> Thus said he to him; and his younger brother did
all things as his elder brother had spoken unto him to do them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when the morn was come, they went to the fields with
their things; and their hearts were pleased exceedingly with
their task in the beginning of their work. And it came to pass
after this that as they were in the field they stopped for corn,
and he sent his younger brother, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHaste thou, bring
to us corn from the farm.‚Äù</span> And the younger brother found
the wife of his elder brother, as she was sitting tying her hair.
He said to her: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGet up, and give to me corn, that I may run
to the field, for my elder brother hastened me; do not delay.‚Äù</span>
She said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGo, open the bin, and thou shalt take to
thyself according to thy will, that I may not drop my locks
of hair while I dress them.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The youth went into the stable; he took a large measure,
for he desired to take much corn; he loaded it with wheat
and barley; and he went out carrying it. She said to him,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHow much of the corn that is wanted, is that which is on
thy shoulder?‚Äù</span> He said to her: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThree bushels of barley,
and two of wheat, in all five; these are what are upon my
shoulder.‚Äù</span> Thus said he to her. And she conversed with
him, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThere is great strength in thee, for I see thy
might every day.‚Äù</span> And her heart knew him with the knowledge
of youth. And she arose and came to him, and conversed
with him, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCome, stay with me, and it shall be well
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for thee, and I will make for thee beautiful garments.‚Äù</span> Then
the youth became like a panther of the south with fury at the
evil speech which she had made to him; and she feared
greatly. And he spake unto her, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold thou art
to me as a mother, thy husband is to me as a father, for he
who is elder than I has brought me up. What is this wickedness
that thou hast said to me? Say it not to me again. For
I will not tell it to any man, for I will not let it be uttered by
the mouth of any man.‚Äù</span> He lifted up his burden, and he went
to the field and came to his elder brother; and they took up
their work, to labor at their task.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now afterward, at eventime, his elder brother was returning
to his house; and the younger brother was following after
his oxen, and he loaded himself with all the things of the field;
and he brought his oxen before him, to make them lie down
in their stable which was in the farm. And behold the wife of
the elder brother was afraid for the words which she had said.
She took a parcel of fat, she became like one who is evilly
beaten, desiring to say to her husband, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt is thy younger
brother who has done this wrong.‚Äù</span> Her husband returned
in the even, as was his wont of every day; he came unto his
house; he found his wife ill of violence; she did not give him
water upon his hands as he used to have, she did not make
a light before him, his house was in darkness, and she was
lying very sick. Her husband said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWho has spoken,
with thee?‚Äù</span> Behold she said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNo one has spoken with me
except thy younger brother. When he came to take for thee
corn he found me sitting alone; he said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòCome, let us
stay together, tie up thy hair.‚Äô</span> Thus spake he to me. I did
not listen to him, but thus spake I to him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòBehold, am I not
thy mother, is not thy elder brother to thee as a father?‚Äô</span> And
he feared, and he beat me to stop me from making report to
thee, and if thou lettest him live I shall die. Now behold he is
coming in the evening; and I complain of these wicked words,
for he would have done this even in daylight.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the elder brother became as a panther of the south;
he sharpened his knife; he took it in his hand; he stood behind
the door of his stable to slay his younger brother as he
came in the evening to bring his cattle into the stable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now the sun went down, and he loaded himself with herbs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in his daily manner. He came, and his foremost cow entered
the stable, and she said to her keeper, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold thou thy elder
brother standing before thee with his knife to slay thee; flee
from before him.‚Äù</span> He heard what his first cow had said; and
the next entering, she also said likewise. He looked beneath
the door of the stable; he saw the feet of his elder brother;
he was standing behind the door, and his knife was in his
hand. He cast down his load to the ground, and betook himself
to flee swiftly; and his elder brother pursued after him
with his knife. Then the younger brother cried out unto Ra
Harakhti, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy good Lord! Thou art he who divides
the evil from the good.‚Äù</span> And Ra stood and heard all his cry;
and Ra made a wide water between him and his elder brother,
and it was full of crocodiles; and the one brother was on one
bank, and the other on the other bank; and the elder brother
smote twice on his hands at not slaying him. Thus did he.
And the younger brother called to the elder on the bank, saying:
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúStand still until the dawn of day; and when Ra ariseth,
I shall judge with thee before him, and he discerneth between
the good and the evil. For I shall not be with thee any more
forever; I shall not be in the place in which thou art; I shall
go to the valley of the acacia.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now when the land was lightened, and the next day appeared,
Ra Harakhti arose, and one looked unto the other.
And the youth spake with his elder brother, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWherefore
earnest thou after me to slay me in craftiness, when thou
didst not hear the words of my mouth? For I am thy brother
in truth, and thou art to me as a father, and thy wife even as
a mother: is it not so? Verily, when I was sent to bring for
us corn, thy wife said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòCome, stay with me‚Äô</span>; for behold
this has been turned over unto thee into another wise.‚Äù</span>
And he caused him to understand of all that happened with
him and his wife. And he swore an oath by Ra Harakhti,
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThy coming to slay me by deceit with thy knife was
an abomination.‚Äù</span> Then the youth took a knife, and cut off
of his flesh, and cast it into the water, and the fish swallowed it.
He failed; he became faint; and his elder brother cursed his
own heart greatly; he stood weeping for him afar off; he
knew not how to pass over to where his younger brother was,
because of the crocodiles. And the younger brother called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unto him, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhereas thou hast devised an evil thing,
wilt thou not also devise a good thing, even like that which I
would do unto thee? When thou goest to thy house thou
must look to thy cattle, for I shall not stay in the place where
thou art; I am going to the valley of the acacia. And now
as to what thou shalt do for me; it is even that thou shalt come
to seek after me, if thou perceivest a matter, namely, that there
are things happening unto me. And this is what shall come
to pass, that I shall draw out my soul, and I shall put it upon
the top of the flowers of the acacia, and when the acacia is
cut down, and it falls to the ground, and thou comest to seek
for it, if thou searchest for it seven years do not let thy heart
be wearied. For thou wilt find it, and thou must put it in a
cup of cold water, and expect that I shall live again, that I may
make answer to what has been done wrong. And thou shalt
know of this, that is to say, that things are happening to me,
when one shall give to thee a cup of beer in thy hand, and it
shall be troubled; stay not then, for verily it shall come to pass
with thee.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the youth went to the valley of the acacia; and his
elder brother went unto his house; his hand was laid on his
head, and he cast dust on his head; he came to his house, and
he slew his wife, he cast her to the dogs, and he sat in mourning
for his younger brother.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now many days after these things, the younger brother
was in the valley of the acacia; there was none with him; he
spent his time in hunting the beasts of the desert, and he came
back in the even to lie down under the acacia, which bore his
soul upon the topmost flower. And after this he built himself
a tower with his own hands, in the valley of the acacia; it was
full of all good things, that he might provide for himself a
home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he went out from his tower, and he met the Nine Gods,
who were walking forth to look upon the whole land. The
Nine Gods talked one with another, and they said unto him:
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHo! Bata, bull of the Nine Gods, art thou remaining alone?
Thou hast left thy village for the wife of Anpu, thy elder
brother. Behold his wife is slain. Thou hast given him an
answer to all that was transgressed against thee.‚Äù</span> And their
hearts were vexed for him exceedingly. And Ra Harakhti
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
said to Khnumu, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold, frame thou a woman for Bata,
that he may not remain alive alone.‚Äù</span> And Khnumu made
for him a mate to dwell with him. She was more beautiful in
her limbs than any woman who is in the whole land. The
essence of every god was in her. The seven Hathors came
to see her: they said with one mouth, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúShe will die a sharp
death.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Bata loved her very exceedingly, and she dwelt in his
house; he passed his time in hunting the beasts of the desert,
and brought and laid them before her. He said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGo not
outside, lest the sea seize thee; for I cannot rescue thee from
it, for I am a woman like thee; my soul is placed on the head
of the flower of the acacia; and if another find it, I must fight
with him.‚Äù</span> And he opened unto her his heart in all its nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now after these things Bata went to hunt in his daily manner.
And the young girl went to walk under the acacia which
was by the side of her house. Then the sea saw her, and cast
its waves up after her. She betook herself to flee from before
it. She entered her house. And the sea called unto the acacia,
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOh, would that I could seize her!‚Äù</span> And the acacia
brought a lock from her hair, and the sea carried it to Egypt,
and dropped it in the place of the fullers of Pharaoh's linen.
The smell of the lock of hair entered into the clothes of
Pharaoh; and they were wroth with the fullers of Pharaoh,
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe smell of ointment is in the clothes of Pharaoh.‚Äù</span>
And the people were rebuked every day, they knew not what
they should do. And the chief fuller of Pharaoh walked by the
bank, and his heart was very evil within him after the daily
quarrel with him. He stood still, he stood upon the sand opposite
to the lock of hair, which was in the water, and he made one
enter into the water and bring it to him; and there was found
in it a smell, exceeding sweet. He took it to Pharaoh; and
they brought the scribes and the wise men, and they said unto
Pharaoh: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis lock of hair belongs to a daughter of Ra
Harakhti: the essence of every god is in her, and it is a tribute
to thee from another land. Let messengers go to every strange
land to seek her: and as for the messenger who shall go to
the valley of the acacia, let many men go with him to bring
her.‚Äù</span> Then said his Majesty, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúExcellent exceedingly is what
has been said to us‚Äù</span>; and they sent them. And many days
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after these things the people who were sent to strange lands
came to give report unto the King: but there came not those
who went to the valley of the acacia, for Bata had slain them,
but let one of them return to give a report to the King. His
Majesty sent many men and soldiers, as well as horsemen, to
bring her back. And there was a woman among them, and to
her had been given in her hand beautiful ornaments of a
woman. And the girl came back with her, and they rejoiced
over her in the whole land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And his Majesty loved her exceedingly, and raised her to
high estate; and he spake unto her that she should tell him
concerning her husband. And she said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet the acacia be
cut down, and let one chop it up.‚Äù</span> And they sent men and
soldiers with their weapons to cut down the acacia; and they
came to the acacia, and they cut the flower upon which was
the soul of Bata, and he fell dead suddenly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when the next day came, and the earth was lightened,
the acacia was cut down. And Anpu, the elder brother of
Bata, entered his house, and washed his hands; and one gave
him a cup of beer, and it became troubled; and one gave him
another of wine, and the smell of it was evil. Then he took
his staff, and his sandals, and likewise his clothes, with his
weapons of war; and he betook himself forth to the valley of
the acacia. He entered the tower of his younger brother, and
he found him lying upon his mat; he was dead. And he wept
when he saw his younger brother verily lying dead. And he
went out to seek the soul of his younger brother under the
acacia tree, under which his younger brother lay in the evening.
He spent three years in seeking for it, but found it not.
And when he began the fourth year, he desired in his heart to
return into Egypt; he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI will go to-morrow morn.‚Äù</span>
Thus spake he in his heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now when the land lightened, and the next day appeared,
he was walking under the acacia; he was spending his time
in seeking it. And he returned in the evening, and labored
at seeking it again. He found a seed. He returned with it.
Behold this was the soul of his younger brother. He brought
a cup of cold water, and he cast the seed into it: and he sat
down, as he was wont. Now when the night came his soul
sucked up the water; Bata shuddered in all his limbs, and he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
looked on his elder brother; his soul was in the cup. Then
Anpu took the cup of cold water, in which the soul of his
younger brother was; Bata drank it, his soul stood again in
its place, and he became as he had been. They embraced each
other, and they conversed together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Bata said to his elder brother: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold I am to become
as a great bull, which bears, every good mark; no one
knoweth its history, and thou must sit upon my back. When
the sun arises I shall be in the place where my wife is, that I
may return answer to her; and thou must take me to the
place where the King is. For all good things shall be done
for thee; for one shall lade thee with silver and gold, because
thou bringest me to Pharaoh, for I become a great marvel, and
they shall rejoice for me in all the land. And thou shalt go to
thy village.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when the land was lightened, and the next day appeared,
Bata became in the form which he had told to his
elder brother. And Anpu sat upon his back until the dawn.
He came to the place where the King was, and they made his
Majesty to know of him; he saw him, and he was exceeding
joyful with him. He made for him great offerings, saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is a great wonder which has come to pass.‚Äù</span> There
were rejoicings over him in the whole land. They presented
unto him silver and gold for his elder brother, who went and
stayed in his village. They gave to the bull many men and
many things, and Pharaoh loved him exceedingly above all
that is in this land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And after many days after these things, the bull entered the
purified place; he stood in the place where the princess was;
he began to speak with her, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold, I am alive indeed.‚Äù</span>
And she said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd, pray, who art thou?‚Äù</span>
He said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am Bata. I perceived when thou causedst
that they should destroy the acacia of Pharaoh, which was my
abode, that I might not be suffered to live. Behold, I am alive
indeed, I am as an ox.‚Äù</span> Then the princess feared exceedingly
for the words that her husband had spoken to her. And he
went out from the purified place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And his Majesty was sitting, making a good day with her:
she was at the table of his Majesty, and the King was exceeding
pleased with her. And she said to his Majesty, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSwear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to me by God, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWhat thou shalt say, I will obey it for
thy sake.‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span> He hearkened unto all that she said, even this.
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet me eat of the liver of the ox, because he is fit for naught.‚Äù</span>
Thus spake she to him. And the King was exceeding sad at
her words, the heart of Pharaoh grieved him greatly. And
after the land was lightened, and the next day appeared, they
proclaimed a great feast with offerings to the ox. And the
King sent one of the chief butchers of his Majesty, to cause
the ox to be sacrificed. And when he was sacrificed, as he
was upon the shoulders of the people, he shook his neck, and
he threw two drops of blood over against the two doors of his
Majesty. The one fell upon the one side, on the great door of
Pharaoh, and the other upon the other door. They grew as
two great Persea trees, and each of them was excellent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And one went to tell unto his Majesty, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTwo great Persea
trees have grown, as a great marvel of his Majesty, in the
night by the side of the great gate of his Majesty.‚Äù</span> And there
was rejoicing for them in all the land, and there were offerings
made to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when the days were multiplied after these things, his
Majesty was adorned with the blue crown, with garlands of
flowers on his neck, and he was upon the chariot of pale gold,
and he went out from the palace to behold the Persea trees:
the princess also was going out with horses behind his Majesty.
And his Majesty sat beneath one of the Persea trees,
and it spake thus with his wife: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOh thou deceitful one, I
am Bata, I am alive, though I have been evilly entreated. I
knew who caused the acacia to be cut down by Pharaoh at my
dwelling. I then became an ox, and thou causedst that I
should be killed.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And many days after these things the princess stood at the
table of Pharaoh, and the King was pleased with her. And
she said to his Majesty, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSwear to me by God, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòThat
which the princess shall say to me I will obey it for her.‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span>
And he hearkened unto all she said. And he commanded,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet these two Persea trees be cut down, and let them be
made into goodly planks.‚Äù</span> And he hearkened unto all she
said. And after this his Majesty sent skilful craftsmen, and
they cut down the Persea trees of Pharaoh; and the princess,
the royal wife, was standing looking on, and they did all that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was in her heart unto the trees. But a chip flew up, and it
entered into the mouth of the princess; she swallowed it, and
after many days she bore a son. And one went to tell his
Majesty, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThere is born to thee a son.‚Äù</span> And they brought
him, and gave to him a nurse and servants; and there were rejoicings
in the whole land. And the King sat making a merry
day, as they were about the naming of him, and his Majesty
loved him exceedingly at that moment, and the King raised
him to be the royal son of Kush.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now after the days had multiplied after these things, his
Majesty made him heir of all the land. And many days after
that, when he had fulfilled many years as heir, his Majesty
flew up to heaven. And the heir said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet my great nobles
of his Majesty be brought before me, that I may make them
to know all that has happened to me.‚Äù</span> And they brought also
before him his wife, and he judged with her before him, and
they agreed with him. They brought to him his elder brother;
he made him hereditary prince in all his land. He was thirty
years King of Egypt, and he died, and his elder brother stood
in his place on the day of burial.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mighty King User.maat.ra (Rameses the Great) had
a son named Setna Kha.em.uast who was a great scribe,
and very learned in all the ancient writings. And he
heard that the magic book of Thoth, by which a man may
enchant heaven and earth, and know the language of all
birds and beasts, was buried in the cemetery of Memphis.
And he went to search for it with his brother An.he.hor.eru;
and when they found the tomb of the King's son, Na.nefer.ka.ptah,
son of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Mer.neb.ptah,
Setna opened it and went in.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now in the tomb was Na.nefer.ka.ptah, and with him was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ka</span></span> of his wife Ahura; for though she was buried at
Koptos, her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ka</span></span> dwelt at Memphis with her husband, whom
she loved. And Setna saw them seated before their offerings, and
the book lay between them. And Na.nefer.ka.ptah said to
Setna, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWho are you that break into my tomb in this way?‚Äù</span>
He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am Setna, son of the great King User.maat.ra,
living forever, and I come for that book which I see between
you.‚Äù</span> And Na.nefer.ka.ptah said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt cannot be given to
you.‚Äù</span> Then said Setna, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBut I will carry it away by force.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Ahura said to Setna, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDo not take this book; for it
will bring trouble on you, as it has upon us. Listen to what
we have suffered for it.‚Äù</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWe were the two children of the King Mer.neb.ptah, and
he loved us very much, for he had no others; and Na.nefer.ka.ptah
was in his palace as heir over all the land. And
when we were grown, the King said to the Queen, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòI will
marry Na.nefer.ka.ptah to the daughter of a general, and
Ahura to the son of another general.‚Äô</span> And the Queen said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNo; he is the heir, let him marry his sister, like the heir of
a king; none other is fit for him.‚Äô</span> And the King said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòThat
is not fair; they had better be married to the children of the
general.‚Äô</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd the Queen said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòIt is you who are not dealing
rightly with me.‚Äô</span> And the King answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòIf I have no more
than these two children, is it right that they should marry one
another? I will marry Na.nefer.ka.ptah to the daughter of
an officer, and Ahura to the son of another officer. It has often
been done so in our family.‚Äô</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd at a time when there was a great feast before the
King, they came to fetch me to the feast. And I was very
troubled, and did not behave as I used to do. And the King
said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòAhura, have you sent someone to me about this
sorry matter, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet me be married to my elder
brother‚Äù</span>?‚Äô</span> I said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWell, let me marry the son of an
officer, and he marry the daughter of another officer, as it often
happens so in our family.‚Äô</span> I laughed, and the King laughed.
And the King told the steward of the palace, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòLet them take
Ahura to the house of Na.nefer.ka.ptah to-night, and all kinds
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of good things with her.‚Äô</span> So they brought me as a wife to the
house of Na.nefer.ka.ptah; and the King ordered them to give
me presents of silver and gold, and things from the palace.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd Na.nefer.ka.ptah passed a happy time with me, and
received all the presents from the palace; and we loved one
another. And when I expected a child, they told the King,
and he was most heartily glad; and he sent me many things,
and a present of the best silver and gold and linen. And when
the time came, I bore this little child that is before you. And
they gave him the name of Mer-ab, and registered him in the
book of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòHouse of life.‚Äô</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd when my brother Na.nefer.ka.ptah went to the cemetery
of Memphis, he did nothing on earth but read the writings
that are in the catacombs of the kings, and the tablets
of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòHouse of life,‚Äô</span> and the inscriptions that are seen on
the monuments, and he worked hard on the writings. And
there was a priest there called Nesi-ptah; and as Na.nefer.ka.ptah
went into a temple to pray, it happened that he went
behind this priest, and was reading the inscriptions that were
on the chapels of the gods. And the priest mocked him and
laughed. So Na.nefer.ka.ptah said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWhy are you
laughing at me?‚Äô</span> And he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòI was not laughing at you,
or if I happened to do so, it was at your reading writings that
are worthless. If you wish so much to read writings, come
to me, and I will bring you to the place where the book is which
Thoth himself wrote with his own hand, and which will bring
you to the gods. When you read but two pages in this you
will enchant the heaven, the earth, the abyss, the mountains,
and the sea; you shall know what the birds of the sky and the
crawling things are saying; you shall see the fishes of the
deep, for a divine power is there to bring them up out of the
depth. And when you read the second page, if you are in the
world of ghosts, you will become again in the shape you were
in on earth. You will see the sun shining in the sky, with all
the gods, and the full moon.‚Äô</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd Na.nefer.ka.ptah said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòBy the life of the King!
Tell me of anything you want done and I'll do it for you, if
you will only send me where this book is.‚Äô</span> And the priest
answered Na.nefer.ka.ptah, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòIf you want to go to the place
where the book is, you must give me 100 pieces of silver for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
my funeral, and provide that they shall bury me as a rich
priest.‚Äô</span> So Na.nefer.ka.ptah called his lad and told him to give
the priest 100 pieces of silver; and he made them do as he
wished, even everything that he asked for. Then the priest
said to Na.nefer.ka.ptah: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòThis book is in the middle of the
river at Koptos, in an iron box; in the iron box is a bronze
box; in the bronze box is a sycamore box; in the sycamore
box is an ivory and ebony box; in the ivory and ebony box is
a silver box; in the silver box is a golden box, and in that is
the book. It is twisted all round with snakes and scorpions
and all the other crawling things around the box in which the
book is; and there is a deathless snake by the box.‚Äô</span> And when
the priest told Na.nefer.ka.ptah, he did not know where on
earth he was, he was so much delighted.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd when he came from the temple he told me all that
had happened to him. And he said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòI shall go to Koptos,
for I must fetch this book; I will not stay any longer in the
north.‚Äô</span> And I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòLet me dissuade you, for you prepare
sorrow and you will bring me into trouble in the Thebaid.‚Äô</span>
And I laid my hand on Na.nefer.ka.ptah, to keep him from
going to Koptos, but he would not listen to me; and he went
to the King, and told the King all that the priest had said.
The King asked him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWhat is it that you want?‚Äô</span> and he replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòLet them give me the royal boat with its belongings,
for I will go to the south with Ahura and her little boy Mer-ab,
and fetch this book without delay.‚Äô</span> So they gave him the
royal boat with its belongings, and we went with him to the
haven, and sailed from there up to Koptos.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThen the priests of Isis of Koptos, and the high-priest of
Isis, came down to us without waiting, to meet Na.nefer.ka.ptah,
and their wives also came to me. We went into the temple
of Isis and Harpokrates; and Na.nefer.ka.ptah brought an
ox, a goose, and some wine, and made a burnt-offering and a
drink-offering before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. They
brought us to a very fine house, with all good things; and
Na.nefer.ka.ptah spent four days there and feasted with the
priests of Isis of Koptos, and the wives of the priests of Isis
also made holiday with me.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd the morning of the fifth day came; and Na.nefer.ka.ptah
called a priest to him, and made a magic cabin that was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
full of men and tackle. He put the spell upon it, and put life
in it, and gave them breath, and sank it in the water. He filled
the royal boat with sand, and took leave of me, and sailed from
the haven: and I sat by the river at Koptos that I might see
what would become of him. And he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWorkmen, work
for me, even at the place where the book is.‚Äô</span> And they toiled
by night and by day; and when they had reached it in three
days, he threw the sand out, and made a shoal in the river.
And then he found on it entwined serpents and scorpions and
all kinds of crawling things around the box in which the book
was; and by it he found a deathless snake around the box.
And he laid the spell upon the entwined serpents and scorpions
and all kinds of crawling things which were around the box,
that they should not come out. And he went to the deathless
snake, and fought with him, and killed him; but he came to
life again, and took a new form. He then fought again with
him a second time; but he came to life again, and took a third
form. He then cut him in two parts, and put sand between the
parts, that he should not appear again.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNa.nefer.ka.ptah then went to the place where he found
the box. He uncovered a box of iron, and opened it; he found
then a box of bronze, and opened that; then he found a box
of sycamore wood, and opened that; again, he found a box
of ivory and ebony, and opened that; yet, he found a box of
silver, and opened that; and then he found a box of gold; he
opened that, and found the book in it. He took the book from
the golden box, and read a page of spells from it. He enchanted
the heaven and the earth, the abyss, the mountains,
and the sea; he knew what the birds of the sky, the fish of
the deep, and the beasts of the hills all said. He read another
page of the spells, and saw the sun shining in the sky, with
all the gods, the full moon, and the stars in their shapes; he
saw the fishes of the deep, for a divine power was present that
brought them up from the water. He then read the spell upon
the workmen that he had made, and taken from the haven,
and said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWork for me, back to the place from which
I came.‚Äô</span> And they toiled night and day, and so he came back
to the place where I sat by the river of Koptos; I had not
drunk nor eaten anything, and had done nothing on earth, but
sat like one who is gone to the grave.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI then told Na.nefer.ka.ptah that I wished to see this book,
for which we had taken so much trouble. He gave the book
into my hands; and when I read a page of the spells in it I
also enchanted heaven and earth, the abyss, the mountains,
and the sea. I also knew what the birds of the sky, the fishes
of the deep, and the beasts of the hills all said. I read another
page of the spells, and I saw the sun shining in the sky with
all the gods, the full moon, and the stars in their shapes; I
saw the fishes of the deep, for a divine power was present that
brought them up from the water. As I could not write, I asked
Na.nefer.ka.ptah, who was a good writer, and a very learned
one; he called for a new piece of papyrus, and wrote on it all
that was in the book before him. He dipped it in beer, and
washed it off in the liquid; for he knew that if it were washed
off, and he drank it, he would know all that there was in the
writing.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWe returned back to Koptos the same day, and made a
feast before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. We then went
to the haven and sailed, and went northward of Koptos. And
as we went on Thoth discovered all that Na.nefer.ka.ptah had
done with the book; and Thoth hastened to tell Ra, and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow know that my book and my revelation are with Na.nefer.ka.ptah,
son of the King Mer.neb.ptah. He has forced
himself into my place, and robbed it, and seized my box with
the writings, and killed my guards who protected it.‚Äô</span> And
Ra replied to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòHe is before you, take him and all his kin.‚Äô</span>
He sent a power from heaven with the command, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòDo not let
Na.nefer.ka.ptah return safe to Memphis with all his kin.‚Äô</span>
And after this hour, the little boy Mer-ab, going out from the
awning of the royal boat, fell into the river: he called on Ra,
and everybody who was on the bank raised a cry. Na.nefer.ka.ptah
went out of the cabin, and read the spell over him;
he brought his body up because a divine power brought him
to the surface. He read another spell over him, and made him
tell of all what happened to him, and of what Thoth had said
before Ra.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWe turned back with him to Koptos. We brought him

went to the haven, we sailed, and did not stay to the north of
Koptos. When we were come to the place where the little
boy Mer-ab had fallen into the water, I went out from the
awning of the royal boat, and I fell into the river. They called
Na.nefer.ka.ptah, and he came out from the cabin of the royal
boat; he read a spell over me, and brought my body up, because
a divine power brought me to the surface. He drew me
out, and read the spell over me, and made me tell him of all
that had happened to me, and of what Thoth had said before
Ra. Then he turned back with me to Koptos, he brought me
to the Good House, he fetched the people to me, and made one
embalm me, as great and noble people are buried, and laid me
in the tomb where Mer-ab my young child was.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe turned to the haven, and sailed down, and delayed not
in the north of Koptos. When he was come to the place where

turn back again to Koptos, that I may lie by them? For, if
not, when I go down to Memphis, and the King asks after his
children, what shall I say to him? Can I tell him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI have
taken your children to the Thebaid, and killed them, while I
remained alive, and I have come to Memphis still alive‚Äù</span>?‚Äô</span>
Then he made them bring him a linen cloth of striped byssus;
he made a band, and bound the book firmly, and tied it upon
him. Na.nefer.ka.ptah then went out of the awning of the
royal boat and fell into the river. He cried on Ra; and all
those who were on the bank made an outcry, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòGreat
woe! Sad woe! Is he lost, that good scribe and able man that
has no equal?‚Äô</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe royal boat went on, without anyone on earth knowing
where Na.nefer.ka.ptah was. It went on to Memphis, and
they told all this to the King. Then the King went down to
the royal boat in mourning, and all the soldiers and high-priests
of Ptah were in mourning, and all the officials and
courtiers. And when he saw Na.nefer.ka.ptah, who was in
the inner cabin of the royal boat‚Äîfrom his rank of high scribe‚Äîhe
lifted him up. And they saw the book by him; and the
King said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòLet one hide this book that is with him.‚Äô</span> And

the officers of the King, the priests of Ptah, and the high-priest

And Setna said to Ahura, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGive me the book which I see
between you and Na.nefer.ka.ptah; for if you do not I will
take it by force.‚Äù</span> Then Na.nefer.ka.ptah rose from his seat
and said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAre you Setna, to whom my wife has told of all
these blows of fate, which you have not suffered? Can you
take this book by your skill as a good scribe? If, indeed, you
can play games with me, let us play a game, then, of 52 points.‚Äù</span>
And Setna said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am ready,‚Äù</span> and the board and its
pieces were put before him. And Na.nefer.ka.ptah won a
game from Setna; and he put the spell upon him, and defended
himself with the game board that was before him, and sunk
him into the ground above his feet. He did the same at the
second game, and won it from Setna, and sunk him into the
ground to his waist. He did the same at the third game, and
made him sink into the ground up to his ears. Then Setna
struck Na.nefer.ka.ptah a great blow with his hand. And
Setna called his brother An.he.hor.eru and said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMake
haste and go up upon earth, and tell the King all that has happened
to me, and bring me the talisman of my father Ptah, and
my magic books.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he hurried up upon earth, and told the King all that
had happened to Setna. The King said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBring him the
talisman of his father Ptah, and his magic books.‚Äù</span> And An.he.hor.eru
hurried down into the tomb; he laid the talisman on
Setna, and he sprang up again immediately. And then Setna
reached out his hand for the book, and took it. Then‚Äîas
Setna went out from the tomb‚Äîthere went a Light before
him, and Darkness behind him. And Ahura wept at him, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
she said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGlory to the King of Darkness! Hail to the King
of Light! all power is gone from the tomb.‚Äù</span> But Na.nefer.ka.ptah
said to Ahura: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDo not let your heart be sad; I will
make him bring back this book, with a forked stick in his
hand, and a fire-pan on his head.‚Äù</span> And Setna went out from
the tomb, and it closed behind him as it was before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Setna went to the King, and told him everything that
had happened to him with the book. And the King said to
Setna, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTake back the book to the grave of Na.nefer.ka.ptah,
like a prudent man, or else he will make you bring it with a
forked stick in your hand, and a fire-pan on your head.‚Äù</span> But
Setna would not listen to him; and when Setna had unrolled
the book he did nothing on earth but read it to everybody.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
[Here follows a story of how Setna, walking in the court of
the temple of Ptah, met Tabubua, a fascinating girl, daughter
of a priest of Bast, of Ankhtaui; how she repelled his advances,
until she had beguiled him into giving up all his possessions,
and slaying his children. At the last she gives a fearful cry
and vanishes, leaving Setna bereft of even his clothes. This
would seem to be merely a dream, by the disappearance of
Tabubua, and by Setna finding his children alive after it all;
but on the other hand he comes to his senses in an unknown
place, and is so terrified as to be quite ready to make restitution
to Na.nefer.ka.ptah. The episode, which is not creditable
to Egyptian society, seems to be intended for one of the vivid
dreams which the credulous readily accept as half realities.]
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So Setna went to Memphis, and embraced his children for
that they were alive. And the King said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWere you
not drunk to do so?‚Äù</span> Then Setna told all things that had
happened with Tabubua and Na.nefer.ka.ptah. And the King
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSetna, I have already lifted up my hand against you
before, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòHe will kill you if you do not take back the
book to the place you took it from.‚Äô</span> But you have never listened
to me till this hour. Now, then, take the book to Na.nefer.ka.ptah,
with a forked stick in your hand, and a fire-pan
on your head.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So Setna went out from before the King, with a forked stick
in his hand, and a fire-pan on his head. He went down to the
tomb in which was Na.nefer.ka.ptah. And Ahura said to him,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt is Ptah, the great god, that has brought you back safe.‚Äù</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Na.nefer.ka.ptah laughed, and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is the business
that I told you before.‚Äù</span> And when Setna had praised Na.nefer.ka.ptah,
he found it as the proverb says, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe sun was
in the whole tomb.‚Äù</span> And Ahura and Na.nefer.ka.ptah besought
Setna greatly. And Setna said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNa.nefer.ka.ptah, is
it aught disgraceful (that you lay on me to do)?‚Äù</span> And Na.nefer.ka.ptah
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSetna, you know this, that Ahura and
Mer-ab, her child, behold! they are in Koptos; bring them
here into this tomb, by the skill of a good scribe. Let it be impressed
upon you to take pains, and to go to Koptos to bring
them here.‚Äù</span> Setna then went out from the tomb to the King,
and told the King all that Na.nefer.ka.ptah had told him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The King said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSetna, go to Koptos and bring back Ahura
and Mer-ab.‚Äù</span> He answered the King, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet one give me the
royal boat and its belongings.‚Äù</span> And they gave him the royal
boat and its belongings, and he left the haven, and sailed without
stopping till he came to Koptos.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And they made this known to the priests of Isis at Koptos
and to the high-priest of Isis; and behold they came down to
him, and gave him their hand to the shore. He went up with
them and entered into the temple of Isis of Koptos and of
Harpokrates. He ordered one to offer for him an ox, a goose,
and some wine, and he made a burnt-offering and a drink-offering
before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. He went to
the cemetery of Koptos with the priests of Isis and the high-priest
of Isis. They dug about for three days and three nights,
for they searched even in all the catacombs which were in the
cemetery of Koptos; they turned over the steles of the scribes
of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúdouble house of life,‚Äù</span> and read the inscriptions that
they found on them. But they could not find the resting-place
of Ahura and Mer-ab.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now Na.nefer.ka.ptah perceived that they could not find
the resting-place of Ahura and her child Mer-ab. So he raised
himself up as a venerable, very old, ancient, and came before
Setna. And Setna saw him, and Setna said to the ancient,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúYou look like a very old man; do you know where is the
resting-place of Ahura and her child Mer-ab?‚Äù</span> The ancient
said to Setna: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt was told by the father of the father of my
father to the father of my father, and the father of my father
has told it to my father; the resting-place of Ahura and of her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
child Mer-ab is in a mound south of the town of Pehemato(?).‚Äù</span>
And Setna said to the ancient, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPerhaps we may do damage
to Pehemato, and you are ready to lead one to the town for
the sake of that.‚Äù</span> The ancient replied to Setna: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIf one listens
to me, shall he therefore destroy the town of Pehemato!
If they do not find Ahura and her child Mer-ab under the
south corner of their town may I be disgraced.‚Äù</span> They attended
to the ancient, and found the resting-place of Ahura
and her child Mer-ab under the south corner of the town of
Pehemato. Setna laid them in the royal boat to bring them
as honored persons, and restored the town of Pehemato as it
originally was. And Na.nefer.ka.ptah made Setna to know
that it was he who had come to Koptos, to enable them to
find out where the resting-place was of Ahura and her child
Mer-ab.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So Setna left the haven in the royal boat, and sailed without
stopping, and reached Memphis with all the soldiers who were
with him. And when they told the King he came down to the
royal boat. He took them as honored persons escorted to the
catacombs, in which Na.nefer.ka.ptah was, and smoothed
down the ground over them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the King's son Hordedef said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThy state is that of
one who lives to good old age; for old age is the end of our
voyage, the time of embalming, the time of burial. Lie, then,
in the sun, free of infirmities, without the babble of dotage:
this is the salutation to worthy age. I come from far to call
thee, with a message from my father Khufu, the blessed, for
thou shalt eat of the best which the King gives, and of the
food which those have who follow after him; that he may bring
thee in good estate to thy fathers who are in the tomb.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Dedi replied to him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPeace to thee! Peace to thee!
Hordedef, son of the King, beloved of his father. May thy
father Khufu, the blessed, praise thee, may he advance thee
among the elders, may thy <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ka</span></span> prevail against the enemy,
may thy soul know the right road to the gate of him who clothes
the afflicted; this is the salutation to the King's son.‚Äù</span> Then
the King's son, Hordedef, stretched forth his hands to him,
and raised him up, and went with him to the haven, giving
unto him his arm. Then said Dedi, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet there be given me
a boat, to bring me my youths and my books.‚Äù</span> And they
made ready for him two boats with their rowers. And Dedi
went down the river in the barge in which was the King's son,
Hordedef. And when he had reached the palace, the King's
son, Hordedef, entered in to give account unto his Majesty
the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khufu, the blessed.
Then said the King's son Hordedef, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúO King, life, wealth,
and health! My lord, I have brought Dedi.‚Äù</span> His Majesty
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBring him to me speedily.‚Äù</span> And his Majesty went
into the hall of columns of Pharaoh (life, wealth, and health),
and Dedi was led before him. And his Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWherefore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is it, Dedi, that I have not yet seen thee?‚Äù</span> And Dedi
answered: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe who is called it is that comes; the King (life,
wealth, and health) calls me, and behold I come.‚Äù</span> And his
Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIs it true, that which men say, that thou canst
restore the head which is smitten off?‚Äù</span> And Dedi replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTruly, I know that, O King (life, wealth, and health), my
lord.‚Äù</span> And his Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet one bring me a prisoner
who is in prison, that his punishment may be fulfilled.‚Äù</span> And
Dedi said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet it not be a man, O King, my lord; behold
we do not even thus to our cattle.‚Äù</span> And a duck was brought
unto him, and its head was cut off. And the duck was laid
on the west side of the hall, and its head on the east side of
the hall. And Dedi spake his magic speech. And the duck
fluttered along the ground, and its head came likewise; and
when it had come part to part the duck stood and quacked.
And they brought likewise a goose before him, and he did even
so unto it. His Majesty caused an ox to be brought, and its
head cast on the ground. And Dedi spake his magic speech.
And the ox stood upright behind him, and followed him with
his halter trailing on the ground.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And King Khufu said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd is it true what is said, that thou
knowest the number of the designs of the dwelling of Tahuti?‚Äù</span>
And Dedi replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPardon me, I know not their number, O
King (life, wealth, and health), but I know where they are.‚Äù</span>
And his Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhere is that?‚Äù</span> And Dedi replied:
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThere is a chest of whetstone in a chamber named the plan-room,
in Heliopolis; they are in this chest.‚Äù</span> And Dedi said
further unto him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúO King (life, wealth, and health), my lord,
it is not I that is to bring them to thee.‚Äù</span> And his Majesty said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWho, then, is it that shall bring them to me?‚Äù</span> And Dedi
answered to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt is the eldest of the three children who are
in the body of Rud-didet who shall bring them to thee.‚Äù</span> And
his Majesty said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWould that it may be as thou sayest!
And who is this Rud-didet?‚Äù</span> And Dedi replied: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúShe is
the wife of a priest of Ra, lord of Sakhebu. And she has conceived
these three sons by Ra, lord of Sakhebu, and the god
has promised her that they shall fulfil this noble office (of
reigning) over all this land, and that the eldest of them shall
be high-priest in Heliopolis.‚Äù</span> And his Majesty's heart became
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
troubled for this; but Dedi spake unto him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhat is
this that thou thinkest, O King (life, wealth, health), my lord?
Is it because of these three children? I tell thee thy son shall
reign, and thy son's son, and then one of them.‚Äù</span> His Majesty
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd when shall Rud-didet bear these?‚Äù</span> And he replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúShe shall bear them on the twenty-fifth of the month
Tybi.‚Äù</span> And his Majesty said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhen the banks of the canal
of Letopolis are cut, I will walk there that I may see the temple
of Ra, lord of Sakhebu.‚Äù</span> And Dedi replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThen I will
cause that there be four cubits of water by the banks of the
canal of Letopolis.‚Äù</span> When his Majesty returned to his palace,
his Majesty said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet them place Dedi in the house of the
royal son Hordedef, that he may dwell with him, and let them
give him a daily portion of 1,000 loaves, 100 draughts of beer,
an ox, and 100 bunches of onions.‚Äù</span> And they did everything
as his Majesty commanded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And one day it came to pass that Rud-didet felt the pains of
birth. And the majesty of Ra, Lord of Sakhebu, said unto
Isis, to Nebhat, to Meskhent, to Hakt, and to Khnumu: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGo
ye, and deliver Rud-didet of these three children that she shall
bear, who are to fulfil this noble office over all this land; that
they may build up your temples, furnish your altars with offerings,
supply your tables of libation, and increase your endowments.‚Äù</span>
Then went these deities; their fashion they made as
that of dancing-girls, and Khnumu was with them as a porter.
They drew near unto the house of Ra-user, and found him
standing, with his girdle fallen. And they played before him
with their instruments of music. But he said unto them, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy
ladies, behold, here is a woman who feels the pains of birth.‚Äù</span>
They said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet us see her, for we know how to help
her.‚Äù</span> And he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCome, then.‚Äù</span> And they entered in
straightway to Rud-didet, and they closed the door on her
and on themselves. Then Isis stood before her, and Nebhat
stood behind her, and Hakt helped her. And Isis said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúO
child, by thy name of User-ref, do not do violence.‚Äù</span> And
the child came upon her hands, as a child of a cubit; its bones
were strong, the beauty of its limbs was like gold, and its hair
was like true lapis-lazuli. They washed him, and prepared
him, and placed him on a carpet on the brickwork. Then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Meskhent approached him and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is a king who shall
reign over all the land.‚Äù</span> And Khnumu gave strength to his
limbs. Then Isis stood before her, and Nebhat stood behind
her, and Hakt helped her. And Isis said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúO child, by thy
name of Sah-ra, stay not in her.‚Äù</span> Then the child came upon
her hands, a child of a cubit; its bones were strong, the beauty
of its limbs was like gold, and its hair was like true lapis-lazuli.
They washed him, and prepared him, and laid him on a carpet
on the brickwork. Then Meskhent approached him and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is a king who shall reign over all the land.‚Äù</span> And
Khnumu gave strength to his limbs. Then Isis stood before
her, and Nebhat stood behind her, and Hakt helped her. And
Isis said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúO child, by thy name of Kaku, remain not in darkness
in her.‚Äù</span> And the child came upon her hands, a child of a
cubit; its bones were strong, the beauty of its limbs was like
gold, and its hair was like true lapis-lazuli. And Meskhent
approached him and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is a king who shall reign
over all the land.‚Äù</span> And Khnumu gave strength to his limbs.
And they washed him, and prepared him, and laid him on a
carpet on the brickwork.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the deities went out, having delivered Rud-didet of the
three children. And they said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúRejoice! O Ra-user, for behold
three children are born unto thee.‚Äù</span> And he said unto
them, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy ladies, and what shall I give unto ye? Behold,
give this bushel of barley here unto your porter, that ye may
take it as your reward to the brew-house.‚Äù</span> And Khnumu
loaded himself with the bushel of barley. And they went
away toward the place from which they came. And Isis spake
unto these goddesses, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWherefore have we come
without doing a marvel for these children, that we may tell
it to their father who has sent us?‚Äù</span> Then made they the
divine diadems of the King (life, wealth, and health), and laid
them in the bushel of barley. And they caused the clouds to
come with wind and rain; and they turned back again unto the
house. And they said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet us put this barley in a closed
chamber, sealed up, until we return northward, dancing.‚Äù</span>
And they placed the barley in a close chamber.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Rud-didet purified herself, with a purification of fourteen
days. And she said to her handmaid, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIs the house made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ready?‚Äù</span> And she replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAll things are made ready, but
the brewing barley is not yet brought.‚Äù</span> And Rud-didet said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWherefore is the brewing barley not yet brought?‚Äù</span> And
the servant answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt would all of it long since be ready
if the barley had not been given to the dancing-girls, and lay
in the chamber under their seal.‚Äù</span> Rud-didet said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGo down,
and bring of it, and Ra-user shall give them in its stead when
he shall come.‚Äù</span> And the handmaid went, and opened the
chamber. And she heard talking and singing, music and
dancing, quavering, and all things which are performed for a
king in his chamber. And she returned and told to Rud-didet
all that she had heard. And she went through the chamber,
but she found not the place where the sound was. And she
laid her temple to the sack, and found that the sounds were
in it. She placed it in a chest, and put that in another locker,
and tied it fast with leather, and laid it in the storeroom,
where the things were, and sealed it. And Ra-user came returning
from the field; and Rud-didet repeated unto him these
things; and his heart was glad above all things; and they sat
down and made a joyful day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And after these days it came to pass that Rud-didet was
wroth with her servant, and beat her with stripes. And the
servant said unto those that were in the house: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúShall it be
done thus unto me? She has borne three kings, and I will
go and tell this to his Majesty King Khufu the blessed.‚Äù</span> And
she went, and found the eldest brother of her mother, who
was binding his flax on the floor. And he said to her,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhither goest thou, my little maid?‚Äù</span> And she told him
of all these things. And her brother said to her: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWherefore
comest thou thus to me? Shall I agree to treachery?‚Äù</span>
And he took a bunch of the flax to her, and laid on her a
violent blow. And the servant went to fetch a handful of
water, and a crocodile carried her away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her uncle went therefore to tell of this to Rud-didet;
and he found Rud-didet sitting, her head on her knees, and
her heart beyond measure sad. And he said to her, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy
lady, why makest thou thy heart thus?‚Äù</span> And she answered,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIt is because of this little wretch that was in the house; behold
she went out saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòI will go and tell it.‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span> And he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bowed his head unto the ground, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy lady, she
came and told me of these things, and made her complaint
unto me; and I laid on her a violent blow. And she went
forth to draw water, and a crocodile carried her away.‚Äù</span>

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">The Peasant And The Workman</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There dwelt in the Sekhet Hemat‚Äîor Salt Country‚Äîa
peasant called the Sekhti, with his wife and children,
his asses and his dogs; and he trafficked in all good things
of the Sekhet Hemat to Henenseten. Behold now he went
with rushes, natron, and salt, with wood and pods, with
stones and seeds, and all good products of the Sekhet Hemat.
And this Sekhti journeyed to the south unto Henenseten; and
when he came to the lands of the house of Fefa, north of
Denat, he found a man there standing on the bank, a man
called Hemti‚Äîthe workman‚Äîson of a man called Asri, who
was a serf of the high-steward Meruitensa. Now said this
Hemti, when he saw the asses of Sekhti, that were pleasing in
his eyes, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOh that some good god would grant me to steal
away the goods of Sekhti from him!‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now the Hemti's house was by the dike of the tow-path,
which was straightened, and not wide, as much as the width
of a waistcloth: on the one side of it was the water, and on
the other side of it grew his corn. Hemti said then to his
servant, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHasten! bring me a shawl from the house,‚Äù</span> and
it was brought instantly. Then spread he out this shawl
on the face of the dike, and it lay with its fastening on the
water and its fringe on the corn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now Sekhti approached along the path used by all men.
Said Hemti: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHave a care, Sekhti! you are not going to
trample on my clothes!‚Äù</span> Said Sekhti, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI will do as you
like, I will pass carefully.‚Äù</span> Then went he up on the higher
side. But Hemti said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGo you over my corn, instead of
the path?‚Äù</span> Said Sekhti: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am going carefully; this high
field of corn is not my choice, but you have stopped your
path with your clothes, and will you then not let us pass
by the side of the path?‚Äù</span> And one of the asses filled its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mouth with a cluster of corn. Said Hemti: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLook you, I
shall take away your ass, Sekhti, for eating my corn; behold
it will have to pay according to the amount of the
injury.‚Äù</span> Said Sekhti: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am going carefully; the one way
is stopped, therefore took I my ass by the inclosed ground;
and do you seize it for filling its mouth with a cluster of corn?
Moreover, I know unto whom this domain belongs, even unto
the lord steward Meruitensa. He it is who smites every
robber in this whole land; and shall I then be robbed in his
domain?‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Said Hemti, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is the proverb which men speak: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòA
poor man's name is only his own matter.‚Äô</span> I am he of whom
you spake, even the lord steward of whom you think.‚Äù</span>
Thereon he took to him branches of green tamarisk and
scourged all his limbs, took his asses, and drave them into
the pasture. And Sekhti wept very greatly, by reason of the
pain of what he had suffered. Said Hemti, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLift not up your
voice, Sekhti, or you shall go to the demon of silence.‚Äù</span> Sekhti
answered: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúYou beat me, you steal my goods, and now
would take away even my voice, O demon of silence! If you
will restore my goods, then will I cease to cry out at your
violence.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sekhti stayed the whole day petitioning Hemti, but he would
not give ear unto him. And Sekhti went his way to Khenensuten
to complain to the lord steward Meruitensa. He found
him coming out from the door of his house to embark on his
boat, that he might go to the judgment-hall. Sekhti said:
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHo! turn, that I may please thy heart with this discourse.
Now at this time let one of thy followers, whom thou wilt,
come to me that I may send him to thee concerning it.‚Äù</span> The
lord steward Meruitensa made his follower, whom he chose,
go straight unto him, and Sekhti sent him back with an account
of all these matters. Then the lord steward Meruitensa
accused Hemti unto the nobles who sat with him; and they
said unto him: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBy your leave: As to this Sekhti of yours,
let him bring a witness. Behold thou it is our custom with our
Sekhtis; witnesses come with them; behold, that is our custom.
Then it will be fitting to beat this Hemti for a trifle of
natron and a trifle of salt; if he is commanded to pay for it,
he will pay for it.‚Äù</span> But the high steward Meruitensa held his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
peace; for he would not reply unto these nobles, but would
reply unto the Sekhti.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now Sekhti came to appeal to the lord steward Meruitensa,
and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúO my lord steward, greatest of the great, guide of
the needy:</span>

Now the Sekhti made this speech in the time of the majesty

There were given to him four loaves and two draughts

for him, giving it to a friend of his, who furnished it

The sailor then answered: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNow I shall tell that which
has happened to me, to my very self. I was going to the
mines of Pharaoh, and I went down on the sea on a ship of
150 cubits long and forty cubits wide, with 150 sailors of the
best of Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth, and whose
hearts were stronger than lions. They had said that the wind
would not be contrary, or that there would be none. But as
we approached the land the wind arose, and threw up waves
eight cubits high. As for me, I seized a piece of wood; but
those who were in the vessel perished, without one remaining.
A wave threw me on an island, after that I had been three
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
days alone, without a companion beside my own heart. I laid
me in a thicket, and the shadow covered me. Then stretched
I my limbs to try to find something for my mouth. I found
there figs and grapes, all manner of good herbs, berries and
grain, melons of all kinds, fishes and birds. Nothing was
lacking. And I satisfied myself; and left on the ground that
which was over, of what my arms had been filled withal. I
dug a pit, I lighted a fire, and I made a burnt-offering unto the
gods.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSuddenly I heard a noise as of thunder, which I thought
to be that of a wave of the sea. The trees shook, and the earth
was moved. I uncovered my face, and I saw that a serpent
drew near. He was thirty cubits long, and his beard greater
than two cubits; his body was as overlaid with gold, and
his color as that of true lazuli. He coiled himself before me.</span>

thou sayest not speedily what has brought thee to this isle,
I will make thee know thyself; as a flame thou shalt vanish,

knew not, before thee.‚Äô</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWhat has brought thee, what has brought thee,
little one, what has brought thee to this isle which is in the sea,

the width of it forty cubits. It had 150 sailors of the best of
Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth, and the hearts of
whom were stronger than lions. They said that the wind
would not be contrary, or that there would be none. Each of
them exceeded his companion in the prudence of his heart and
the strength of his arm, and I was not beneath any of them.
A storm came upon us while we were on the sea. Hardly
could we reach to the shore when the wind waxed yet greater,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

piece of wood, while those who were in the boat perished without
one being left with me for three days. Behold me now before

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hereditary prince, royal seal-bearer, confidential friend,
judge, keeper of the gate of the foreigners, true and beloved
royal acquaintance, the royal follower Sanehat says:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I attended my lord as a follower of the King, of the house
of the hereditary princess, the greatly favored, the royal wife,
Ankhet-Usertesen, who shares the dwelling of the royal son
Amenemhat in Kanefer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the thirtieth year, the month Paophi, the seventh day the
god entered his horizon, the King Sehotepabra flew up to
heaven and joined the sun's disk, the follower of the god met
his maker. The palace was silenced, and in mourning, the
great gates were closed, the courtiers crouching on the
ground, the people in hushed mourning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His Majesty had sent a great army with the nobles to the
land of the Temehu (Lybia), his son and heir, the good god
King Usertesen as their leader. Now he was returning, and
had brought away living captives and all kinds of cattle without
end. The councillors of the palace had sent to the West
to let the King know the matter that had come to pass in the
inner hall. The messenger was to meet him on the road, and
reach him at the time of evening: the matter was urgent. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúA
hawk had soared with his followers.‚Äù</span> Thus said he, not to
let the army know of it. Even if the royal sons who commanded
in that army send a message, he was not to speak to
a single one of them. But I was standing near, and heard his
voice while he was speaking. I fled far away, my heart beating,
my arms failing, trembling had fallen on all my limbs.
I turned about in running to seek a place to hide me, and I
threw myself between two bushes, to wait while they should
pass by. Then I turned me toward the south, not from wishing
to come into this place‚Äîfor I knew not if war was declared‚Äînor
even thinking a wish to live after this sovereign,
I turned my back to the sycamore, I reached Shi-Seneferu,
and rested on the open field. In the morning I went on and
overtook a man, who passed by the edge of the road. He asked
of me mercy, for he feared me. By the evening I drew near
to Kher-ahau (? old Cairo), and I crossed the river on a raft
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
without a rudder. Carried over by the west wind, I passed
over to the east to the quarries of Aku and the land of the
goddess Herit, mistress of the red mountain (Gebel Ahmar).
Then I fled on foot, northward, and reached the walls of the
prince, built to repel the Sati. I crouched in a bush for fear
of being seen by the guards, changed each day, who watch on
the top of the fortress. I took my way by night, and at the
lighting of the day I reached Peten, and turned me toward the
valley of Kemur. Then thirst hasted me on; I dried up, and
my throat narrowed, and I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is the taste of death.‚Äù</span>
When I lifted up my heart and gathered strength, I heard a
voice and the lowing of cattle. I saw men of the Sati, and one
of them‚Äîa friend unto Egypt‚Äîknew me. Behold he gave me
water and boiled me milk, and I went with him to his camp;
they did me good, and one tribe passed me on to another. I
passed on to Sun, and reached the land of Adim (Edom).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I had dwelt there half a year Amu-an-shi‚Äîwho is the
Prince of the Upper Tenu‚Äîsent for me and said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDwell
thou with me that thou mayest hear the speech of Egypt.‚Äù</span>
He said thus for that he knew of my excellence, and had heard
tell of my worth, for men of Egypt who were there with him
bore witness of me. Behold he said to me: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúFor what cause
hast thou come hither? Has a matter come to pass in the
palace? Has the King of the two lands, Sehetepabra, gone to
heaven? That which has happened about this is not known.‚Äù</span>
But I answered with concealment, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhen I came
from the land of the Tamahu, and my desires were there
changed in me, if I fled away it was not by reason of remorse
that I took the way of a fugitive; I have not failed in my duty,
my mouth has not said any bitter words, I have not heard
any evil counsel, my name has not come into the mouth of a
magistrate. I know not by what I have been led into this
land.‚Äù</span> And Amu-an-shi said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis is by the will of the
god (King of Egypt); for what is a land like if it know not
that excellent god, of whom the dread is upon the lands of
strangers, as they dread Sekhet in a year of pestilence?‚Äù</span> I
spake to him, and replied: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúForgive me; his son now enters
the palace, and has received the heritage of his father. He is
a god who has none like him, and there is none before him.
He is a master of wisdom, prudent in his designs, excellent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in his decrees, with good-will to him who goes or who comes;
he subdued the land of strangers while his father yet lived
in his palace, and he rendered account of that which his father
destined him to perform. He is a brave man, who verily
strikes with his sword; a valiant one, who has not his equal;
he springs upon the barbarians, and throws himself on the
spoilers; he breaks the horns and weakens the hands, and
those whom he smites cannot raise the buckler. He is fearless,
and dashes the heads, and none can stand before him.
He is swift of foot, to destroy him who flies; and none who
flees from him reaches his home. His heart is strong in his
time; he is a lion who strikes with the claw, and never has he
turned his back. His heart is closed to pity; and when he
sees multitudes, he leaves none to live behind him. He is a
valiant one who springs in front when he sees resistance; he
is a warrior who rejoices when he flies on the barbarians. He
seizes the buckler, he rushes forward, he never needs to strike
again, he slays and none can turn his lance; and when he takes
the bow the barbarians flee from his arms like dogs; for the
great goddess has given to him to strike those who know her
not; and if he reaches forth he spares none, and leaves naught
behind. He is a friend of great sweetness, who knows how
to gain love; his land loves him more than itself, and rejoices
in him more than in its own god; men and women run to his
call. A king, he has ruled from his birth; he, from his birth,
has increased births, a sole being, a divine essence, by whom
this land rejoices to be governed. He enlarges the borders of
the South; but he covets not the lands of the North: he does
not smite the Sati, nor crush the Nemau-shau. If he descends
here, let him know thy name, by the homage which thou
wilt pay to his majesty. For he refuses not to bless the land
which obeys him.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And he replied to me: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEgypt is indeed happy and well
settled; behold thou art far from it, but whilst thou art with
me I will do good unto thee.‚Äù</span> And he placed me before his
children, he married his eldest daughter to me, and gave me
the choice of all his land, even among the best of that which
he had on the border of the next land. It is a goodly land,
Iaa is its name. There are figs and grapes; there is wine commoner
than water; abundant is the honey, many are its olives;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and all fruits are upon its trees: there are barley and wheat,
and cattle of kinds without end. This was truly a great thing
that he granted me, when the prince came to invest me, and
establish me as prince of a tribe in the best of his land. I
had my continual portion of bread and of wine each day, of
cooked meat, of roasted fowl, as well as the wild game which
I took, or which was brought to me, beside what my dogs
captured. They made me much butter, and prepared milk of
all kinds. I passed many years, the children that I had became
great, each ruling his tribe. When a messenger went or
came to the palace, he turned aside from the way to come to
me; for I helped every man. I gave water to the thirsty, I set
on his way him who went astray, and I rescued the robbed.
The Sati who went far, to strike and turn back the princes
of other lands, I ordained their goings; for the Prince of the
Tenu for many years appointed me to be general of his
soldiers. In every land which I attacked I played the champion,
I took the cattle, I led away the vassals, I carried off the
slaves, I slew the people, by my sword, my bow, my marches
and my good devices. I was excellent to the heart of my
prince; he loved me when he knew my power, and set me over
his children when he saw the strength of my arms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A champion of the Tenu came to defy me in my tent: a
bold man without equal, for he had vanquished the whole
country. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet Sanehat fight with me‚Äù</span>; for he desired
to overthrow me; he thought to take my cattle for his
tribe. The prince counselled with me. I said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI know him
not. I certainly am not of his degree, I hold me far from his
place. Have I ever opened his door, or leaped over his fence?
It is some envious jealousy from seeing me; does he think
that I am like some steer among the cows, whom the bull
overthrows? If this is a wretch who thinks to enrich himself
at my cost, not a Bedawi and a Bedawi fit for fight, then let us
put the matter to judgment. Verily a true bull loves battle,
but a vainglorious bull turns his back for fear of contest; if
he has a heart for combat, let him speak what he pleases. Will
God forget what he has ordained, and how shall that be
known?‚Äù</span> I lay down; and when I had rested I strung my
bow, I made ready my arrows, I loosened my poniard, I furbished
my arms. At dawn the land of the Tenu came together;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it had gathered its tribes and called all the neighboring
people, it spake of nothing but the fight. Each heart burnt
for me, men and women crying out; for each heart was
troubled for me, and they said: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIs there another strong
one who would fight with him? Behold the adversary has a
buckler, a battle-axe, and an armful of javelins.‚Äù</span> Then I
drew him to the attack; I turned aside his arrows, and they
struck the ground in vain. One drew near to the other, and
he fell on me, and then I shot him. My arrow fastened in
his neck, he cried out, and fell on his face: I drove his lance
into him, and raised my shout of victory on his back. While
all the men of the land rejoiced, I, and his vassals whom he
had oppressed, gave thanks unto Mentu. This prince, Amu-an-shi,
embraced me. Then I carried off his goods and took
his cattle, that which he had wished to do to me, I did even
so unto him; I seized that which was in his tent, I spoiled his
dwelling. As time went on I increased the richness of my
treasures and the number of my cattle.

<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNow behold what the god has done for me who trusted in
him. Having once fled away, yet now there is a witness of me

in the palace give unto me a good name. After that I had
been dying of hunger, now I give bread to those around. I
had left my land naked, and now I am clothed in fine linen.
After having been a wanderer without followers, now I
possess many serfs. My house is fine, my land wide, my
memory is established in the temple of all the gods. And let
this flight obtain thy forgiveness; that I may be appointed in
the palace; that I may see the place where my heart dwells.
How great a thing is it that my body should be embalmed in
the land where I was born! To return there is happiness.
I have made offering to God to grant me this thing. His
heart suffers who has run away unto a strange land. Let him
hear the prayer of him who is afar off, that he may revisit the

age comes, feebleness seizes me, my eyes are heavy, my arms

not; but if thy word was denied, thou didst not speak
again in the assembly of the nobles, even if thou wast desired.
Now, therefore, that thou hast thought on this matter which

Atmu, and of his fellow-gods, of Sopdu, Neferbiu, Samsetu,

I have made: I did not have it in my heart; it was like the

sees himself in the deserts. There was no fear, there was
no hastening after me, I did not listen to an evil plot, my name

I made a feast in Iaa, to pass over my goods to my children.
My eldest son was leading my tribe, all my goods passed to
him, and I gave him my corn and all my cattle, my fruit, and
all my pleasant trees. When I had taken my road to the
south, and arrived at the roads of Horus, the officer who was
over the garrison sent a messenger to the palace to give
notice. His Majesty sent the good overseer of the peasants
of the King's domains, and boats laden with presents from
the King for the Sati who had come to conduct me to the
roads of Horus. I spoke to each one by his name, and I gave

When the land was brightened, and the new day began,
four men came with a summons for me; and the four men

brought me on the way to the royal chamber.

I found his Majesty on the great throne in the hall of pale

presence I was, knew me not. He questioned me graciously,
but I was as one seized with blindness, my spirit fainted, my
limbs failed, my heart was no longer in my bosom, and I knew
the difference between life and death. His Majesty said to
one of the companions, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLift him up, let him speak to me.‚Äù</span>

things, a place of coolness, fruits of the granary, treasures of
the White House, clothes of the King's guardrobe, frankincense,
the finest perfumes of the King and the nobles whom he

Years were removed from my limbs: I was shaved, and
polled my locks of hair; the foulness was cast to the desert
with the garments of the Nemau-sha. I clothed me in fine
linen, and anointed myself with the fine oil of Egypt; I laid
me on a bed. I gave up the sand to those who lie on it; the
oil of wood to him who would anoint himself therewith.
There was given to me the mansion of a lord of serfs, which
had belonged to a royal friend. There many excellent things
were in its buildings; all its wood was renewed. There were
brought to me portions from the palace, thrice and four times
each day; beside the gifts of the royal children, always without
ceasing. There was built for me a pyramid of stone
among the pyramids. The overseer of the architects measured
its ground; the chief treasurer wrote it; the sacred masons cut
the well; the chief of the laborers on the tombs brought the
bricks; all things used to make a strong building were there
used. There were given to me peasants; there were made for

From these letters we learn clearly that the Mongol kings
near the Euphrates (and, as appears later, in Armenia) were
leagued with the Hittites of Mer'ash in the extreme north of
Syria, and of Kadesh on the Orontes, and were supported by
the Amorites of the northern Lebanon and by some of the
Ph≈ìnicians; that the enemy marched south, a distance of 300
miles, taking all the towns in the Baalbek Valley, reaching
Damascus by the gorge of the Barada River, and advancing
into the land of Ham‚Äîin Bashan‚Äîwhere all the chief towns
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fell. This serves to make clear the treachery of Aziru's letters
which follow. The Amorite advance on the Ph≈ìnician coast
was contemporary, and extended to Tyre. It appears, however,
that the Amorites were a Semitic people, while the names
of the Hittites are Mongolic.

From these letters by Aziru, we must conclude either that
he was a great liar or that he was induced to change sides later.
The other correspondents seem to have believed that he had
long deceived the King of Egypt; but, in the end, his invasion
of Ph≈ìnicia‚Äîperhaps cloaked by pretences of hostility to the
Hittite league‚Äîcaused him, as we shall see, to be proclaimed
a rebel. The quarrel with Simyra may have been due to his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
being pushed south, out of his dominions, but is here said to
be due to a Ph≈ìnician league with his foes. It does not appear
who Khatib was. Perhaps the name was Hittite,<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> and he
may have been the Prince of Hamath or of Emesa. The following
letter from Aziru's father, Abdasherah, belongs to a
later period of the war, when Ullaza and all the cities north of
Gebal had been conquered by the Amorites. It is couched in
the same insidious language; and the letters of Ribadda, which
follow, show that Amenophis was not open to conviction for a
long time, though warned by his true friends. The proclamation
is still later, after the attack on Sidon, and may fitly conclude
the Amorite correspondence.

This seems to be the last of Ribadda's fifty letters. There
is no mention of any return to Gebal, or of victory over the

can only hope he did. It was too late when his father obtained
promise of aid. So energetic a writer would probably
have written again if he had been alive to do so. The Amorite

Unfortunately King Jabin does not mention the nationality
of the enemy. From the Tyre letters he seems to have been
an enemy of the Ph≈ìnicians, being perhaps on the side of
Aziru; but the date of the present letters is not fixed by any
reference to persons mentioned in the other letters. It is quite
possible that the Hebrews, and not the Hittites, were his foes,
since the Hebrew conquest took place in the lifetime of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yankhamu</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Suta</span></span>, who are noticed in the northern letters also.
If he was a friend of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aziru's</span></span>, the enemy, though enemies of
Egypt, could not well have been Hittites or Amorites; and
the name of the King is that of Joshua's enemy, Jabin of
Hazor. It is clear that the Egyptians, though expected, were
not in Hazor at the time. The kings of Hazor ruled lower
Galilee, where they had a force of chariots a century later. In
Joshua's time (Josh. xi.) there were also many chariots in and
near Hazor.

It is remarkable that none of the letters from Tell Amarna
refer to central Palestine. There is no mention of any town
in lower Galilee or in Samaria, except Zabuba and Megiddo.
Taanach, Shechem, Jezreel, Dothan, Bethel, and other such
places are unnoticed, as well as Heshbon, Medeba, Rabbath-Ammon,
Ramoth Gilead, and other places in Moab and Gilead.
The Egyptians probably had no stations in these wild mountains,
where their chariots could not pass. The Egyptian
traveller mentions no town between Megiddo and Joppa in
the time of Rameses II, and no towns in the regions of
Samaria or Gilead or Moab occur in the list of places taken
by Thothmes III; nor were there any stations in the Hebron
mountains.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> On the other hand, many places in Sharon and

This letter (confirmed by <a href="#amarna_154_b" class="tei tei-ref">154 B.</a>) shows that a town near
the sea, not like Megiddo, inland, is intended. Labaya had
apparently taken Makkedah from Biridia, who had been afraid of it
(<a href="#amarna_115_b" class="tei tei-ref">115 B.</a>). The writer of the present letter was probably
Biridia and he was perhaps blockading the province by sea on
the west, while Yasdata, who was on the east (which agrees
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with <a href="#amarna_59_b_m" class="tei tei-ref">59 B. M.</a>), blocked up the stream near 'Anana.
This site would be the Enam of the Bible (Josh. xv. 34), which is thus
fixed at the ruin of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kefr 'Ain</span></span>, by the numerous head springs
which feed the river <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rub√Æn</span></span>, which passes close to Makkedah
on the south. The marshes here between the hills would easily
be dammed, and the water supply of Makkedah (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">el Mugh√¢r</span></span>)
so cut off. Makkedah is close to the only stream of perennial
water south of Joppa, and stands high on a cliff, not far from
the sea. It is in the centre of the province, the boundaries of
which Labaya's sons describe (<a href="#amarna_154_b" class="tei tei-ref">154 B.</a>).

This interesting little letter, which shows she was not one of
the ladies sent to Egypt, though probably a person of importance,
seems perhaps to indicate that the central part of
the country, from which no appeals for help occur in the
letters, was undisturbed. The Amorite-Hittite league came
down to Bashan and to Tyre, but not apparently as far as
Accho. The Hebrews, on the other hand, coming from Seir,
are said to have gone as far north as Rimmon and Shiloh, but
were mainly fighting southward from Ajalon. Between the
two theatres of war lay the whole of Samaria and lower Galilee,
in which Basmath found a refuge.

The names of these villages establish a regular chain of
posts from Gaza, by Lachish, to the valleys of Sorek and Elah,
which seem to have been the most eastern parts of the country
in which chariots were to be found. There is no mention of
chariots at Jerusalem, or at any village which was not accessible
by a flat valley-road. By these posts communication was
kept up, it would seem, with Jerusalem; and the messengers
probably travelled by this route, avoiding Ajalon. It was by
this route that Adonizedek proposed that Amenophis should
come up to help him. Whether any such expedition was attempted,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
none of the letters seem to indicate. The troops
had been withdrawn, and the Egyptian policy seems to have
been to call out the native levies of the Amorite charioteers.
Perhaps, when the five kings had been killed at Makkedah,
no further steps were taken, but the lowlands remained unconquered
till the time of Samuel and David. Even in Solomon's
time Gezer was only received as the dower of the daughter
of the Pharaoh (1 Kings ix. 16) who had burned the place
and killed its Canaanite population. In Judges we read that
Judah <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcould not drive out the inhabitants of the Shephelah
(or lowlands) because they had chariots of iron‚Äù</span> (i. 19). The
coast road was still open when Dusratta was writing to his
son-in-law Amenophis IV twenty years later; and all lower
Galilee was, for some few years, with Philistia and Syria, reconquered
by Rameses II, who, however, never entered the
Jud√¶an mountains.

These inventories of Tadukhipa's marriage outfit show how
far advanced was the civilization of western Asia in the
fourteenth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and indicate not only the native wealth
of gold, silver, copper, and bronze, from Asia Minor and the
Caucasus, but also a trade which brought jade from central
Asia. The art of the age is similar to that of the objects found
at Troy and Mycen√¶, and represented on the Egyptian bas-reliefs,
which give pictures of the tribute from Ph≈ìnicia.
From other tablets in the collection we obtain similar information,
including the use of ivory, as also from the records of
tribute to Thothmes III in 1600 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>

It is also to be remarked that Dusratta invokes the Egyptian

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the great temple of Abu-Simbel, between two pillars of
the first hall, there is a large tablet, which has been added,
evidently, a long time after the completion of the temple.
This tablet, which is the object of the present translation, is
covered with a text of thirty-seven lines, containing a speech
of the god Ptah Totunen to the King Rameses II, and the
answer of the King.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was very likely considered by the kings of Egypt to be
a remarkable piece of literature, as it has been repeated, with
slight alterations, on the pylons of the temple of Medinet-Habu,
built by Rameses III. The tablet, which is decaying
rapidly, has been published three times: first, by Burton, in
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Excerpta Hieroglyphica</span></span>,‚Äù</span> pl. 60; then from the copies of
Champollion, in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monuments de l'Egypte et de la Nubie</span></span>,‚Äù</span>

193. The inscription of Medinet-Habu has been copied and published
by M. Duemichen, in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historische Inschriften</span></span>,‚Äù</span> I,
pl. 7-10, and by M. Jacques de Roug√©, in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inscriptions
recueillis en Egypte</span></span>,‚Äù</span> II, pl. 131-138.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am not aware that any complete translation of this long
text has been made. The first part has been translated into
German by Mr. Duemichen (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die Flotte einer √Ügyptischen
K√∂nigin</span></span>,‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Einleitung</span></span>), from the text at Medinet-Habu; a

Geschichte</span></span>,‚Äù</span> p. 538. The present translation I have made from
the tablet, which, being more ancient than the inscription, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
very likely to be the original. It contains an interesting allusion
to the marriage of Rameses with a daughter of the King
of the Kheta. The inscription at Medinet-Habu, which is
written more carefully than the tablet, and with less abbreviations,
has given me a clue to several obscure passages of the
ancient text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The tablet is surmounted by a cornice, with the winged
disk. Underneath, the god Totunen is seen standing, and
before him Rameses, who strikes with his mace a group of
enemies whom he holds by the hair. Behind the god are the
ovals of six foreign nations, most likely Asiatics: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auentem</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hebuu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tenfu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Temuu</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hetau</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Emtebelu</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inscription above the god is as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

This stele is one of the usual funereal tablets which are
found in the cemeteries at Memphis and Thebes. The
upper part of the tablet is round, and has the two
sacred eyes and symbolical signets, which, as well as the
winged globe, almost invariably surmount these sacred inscriptions,
and of which the meaning has not yet been satisfactorily
determined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immediately below this emblem are two vignettes: in the
first a functionary named Amen-em-ha (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAmen at the beginning‚Äù</span>)
presents a funereal offering to his father Amen-mes

and a young boy, his son, Amen-em-ua (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAmen in the
bark‚Äù</span>). In the second vignette, a principal priest (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">heb</span></span>) of
Osiris, dressed in the sacerdotal leopard's skin, offers incense
to the lady Te-bok (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe servant-maid‚Äù</span>); below is a row
of kneeling figures, namely: two sons, Si-t-mau (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSon of the
mother‚Äù</span>), Amen-Ken (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAmon the warlike‚Äù</span>), and four
daughters, Meri-t-ma (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLoving justice‚Äù</span>), Amen-Set
(<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDaughter of Amen‚Äù</span>), Souten-mau (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúRoyal Mother‚Äù</span>),
and Hui-em-neter (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúFood for god‚Äù</span>). As there is no indication
of relationship between the subjects of the two vignettes,
it may be inferred that Te-Bok was a second wife of
Amen-em-ha.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The lower portion of the tablet is filled up with the following
Hymn to Osiris, written in twenty-eight lines of hieroglyphics
which are very well preserved except wherever the
name of the deity Amen occurs, which has been hammered
out<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>
evidently at the time of the religious revolution in Egypt
under the reign of Amenophis IV, who, assuming the name
of Chu-en-aten (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSplendor,‚Äù</span> or, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGlory of the solar disk‚Äù</span>),
overthrew the worship of the older divinities and principally
that of Amen-RƒÅ; a change which was again overthrown in
the period of his successors, who restored the former letters.
From the style of art and other indications it is almost certain
that the monument was erected in the reign of Thothmes I
of the eighteenth dynasty.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTravels of an Egyptian‚Äù</span> has first been translated
into English by M. C. W. Goodwin (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCambridge Essays,‚Äù</span>
1858, p. 267-269), from a hieratic papyrus in the
British Museum, published in fac-simile by the trustees (Fo.
1842, pl. 35-61). In 1866, M. F. Chabas, availing himself of
the collaboration of M. Goodwin, published a full translation
of the same in French (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyage d'un Egyptien en Syrie, en
Phenicie</span></span>,‚Äù</span> etc., 4to, 1866), including a copy of the hieratic text
with a double transcription into hieroglyphic and Coptic
types, and a perpetual commentary. Objections were made by M. H. Brugsch
(<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revue Critique</span></span>,‚Äù</span> Paris, 1868, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ao√ªt et
Septembre).</span></span> But M. Chabas strongly vindicated his views in an
additional work, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyage d'un Egyptien‚ÄîR√©ponse √† la
Critique</span></span>,‚Äù</span> Ch√¢lons, 1868, 4to, since which the matter seems to
be settled among Egyptologists. The debate was, however,
unimportant in regard to geographical information, as it bore
merely on the point to ascertain whether the narrative refers
to an actual journey really effected by the Egyptian officer
named a Mohar, or a model narrative of a supposed voyage
drawn from a previous relation of a similar trip extant at the
time.

The following short poetical eulogium of a king, apparently
of Menephtah or Seti II of the nineteenth
dynasty, is found in Papyrus Anastasi 4 of the British
Museum. It is published in <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSelect Papyri,‚Äù</span> pl. lxxxiv, l. 2-9;
lxxxv, l. 1. Although not divided by red dots it is clearly
poetic in style, and is accordingly given in paragraphs. From
the final line it appears to be addressed to the monarch after
his death. Although the titles do not exactly correspond with
those of Rameses II, or Menephtah, it appears to relate to him,
as the papyrus is of his reign and that of Seti II of the same
dynasty. It may indeed refer to this later monarch; but as
no cartouche is given and the titles after the palatial or so-called
Horus ones are doubtful, it is uncertain whom the
monarch is to whom it refers. It has been translated by M.
Chabas (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">L'Egypt aux temps de l'exode</span></span>,‚Äù</span> Chalons, 1873, p.

The attention of the reader is specially called to the metrical
structure of this poem. The stanzas, containing upon an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
average ten couplets, are distinctly marked in the original,
the first word in each being written in red letters; hence the
origin of rubricated MSS. Each clause also has a red point
at the close. The resemblance with the earliest Hebrew
poems has been pointed out by the translator in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIntroduction

of the latter date. The translation here given was printed by
myself for the first time in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTransactions of the Society of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These beautiful poems are contained in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnastasi
Papyri‚Äù</span> in the collection at the British Museum.
They have been mostly translated in French by M.
F. Chabas, from whose interpretation I have occasionally
found reason to differ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The papyrus itself is considerably mutilated, and bears no
date, but from the character of the script there can be little
doubt that it is of the period of the nineteenth dynasty.

These hymns have been published by myself with exegetical
notes in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTransactions of the Society of Biblical Arch√¶ology,‚Äù</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The text of the following song, found in the tomb of
Neferhetep at Abd-el-Gurnah, is a good specimen of
Egyptian poetry of the eighteenth dynasty. It was
first copied by Mr. D√ºmichen (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historische Inschriften</span></span>,‚Äù</span> ii.
40), and subsequently by myself. In addition to a translation
in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zeitschrift f√ºr √§gyptische Sprache</span></span>,‚Äù</span> 1873, p. 58, I
gave some critical observations in the same journal of 1875. Professor
Lauth of Munich translated it in an appendix to his
essay on the music of the ancient Egyptians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The song is very remarkable for the form of old Egyptian
poetry, which like that of the Hebrews delights in a sublimer
language, in parallelisms and antitheses, and in the ornament
of a burden; no doubt it was sung, and it seems to be even
rhythmic, forming verses of equal length‚Äî

Though part of the text is unhappily much mutilated, we
yet may gather the general ideas of the poem from the

It is a funeral song, supposed to be sung by the harper at a
feast or anniversary in remembrance of the deceased patriarch
Neferhetep, who is represented sitting with his sister and wife
Rennu-m-ast-neh, his son Ptahmes and his daughter Ta-Khat
standing by their side, while the harper before them is chanting.
The poet addresses his speech as well to the dead as to
the living, assuming in his fiction the former to be yet alive.
The room of the tomb, on the walls of which such texts were
inscribed, may be thought a kind of chapel appointed for the
solemn rites to be performed by the survivors. The song
which bears a great resemblance to the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSong of the House
of King Antef,‚Äù</span> lately translated by the eminent Mr. Goodwin,
affords a striking coincidence with the words which
Herodotus (ii. 78) asserts to have been repeated on such occasions,
while a wooden image of the deceased, probably the
figure called <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">usheb</span></span>,‚Äù</span> was circulating among the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hymn to Amen-RƒÅ-Harmachis (the Sun identified
with the Supreme Deity), of which a translation is
here attempted, is found, with other compositions of
a similar nature, among the Berlin papyri. (No. 5, published
in Lepsius, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Denkm√§ler</span></span>,‚Äù</span> Abth. vi. Bd. 12, pp. 115-117.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It probably belongs to the Ramesside period; the writing
is careful and for the most part very distinct; some <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lacun√¶</span></span> are
met with toward the end, and in a few passages the characters
baffle the present translator's skill in deciphering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Citations from this hymn occur not unfrequently in the
writings of eminent Egyptian scholars, as Brugsch, Dev√©ria,
and others; compare especially Chabas, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Nom de Th√®bes</span></span>,‚Äù</span>
p. 16, where the long antithesis of epithets bestowed on RƒÅ
and his adversaries is described as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfurnishing a page of the
Egyptian dictionary.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As far as I am aware, no complete translation of it was
published till the appearance of Professor Maspero's <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire
Ancienne</span></span>,‚Äù</span> Paris, 1875; where the whole is rendered into
French, pp. 32-35. My own translation was made before I
had the opportunity of seeing this work; since consulting it
I have modified my version of one or two passages in accordance
with M. Maspero's views.

Osiris. It is divided into two parts, very
distinct. The first contains chapters of the funeral ritual in
the hieroglyphic writing; the second, of which a translation
here follows, consists of five pages of a fine hieratic writing
of the lower epoch (probably about the time of the Ptolemies).

This manuscript now belongs to the Royal Museum of
Berlin, where it is registered under the No. 1425.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A partial translation of it was published in 1852 by M. H.
Brugsch (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die Adonisklage und das Linoslied</span></span>‚Äù</span>). He translated
the second page and the beginning of the third, but without
giving the hieratic text. I have since published and
completely translated this interesting document (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Lamentations
d'Isis et de Nephthys</span></span>,‚Äù</span> Paris, 1866), and now give the
English translation revised.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The composition has a great analogy with the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBook of
Respirations,‚Äù</span> a translation of which will be added here. Both
refer to the resurrection and renewed birth of Osiris (the type
of man after his death), who, in this quality, is identified with
the sun, the diurnal renewal of which constantly recalled the
idea of a birth eternally renewed. The object of the prayers
recited by Isis and Nephthys is to effect the resurrection of
their brother Osiris, and also that of the defunct to whom the
papyrus is consecrated.

The following Litany of RƒÅ is the translation of a long
text which is to be found at the entrance of several of
the largest tombs of the kings, in the valley called
Biban el Moluk at Thebes. It is a kind of introduction to the
long pictures which adorn the walls of the royal sepulchres, and
which generally represent the course of the sun at the different
hours of night.

Although very nearly connected with the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBook of the

The importance of this text consists in this, that it gives
us an idea of the esoteric doctrine of the Egyptian priests,
which was clearly pantheistic, and which certainly differed from
the polytheistic worship of the common people.

The manuscript a translation of which here follows belongs
to the Museum of the Louvre, in Paris, where
it is registered under the No. 3284 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dev√©ria, Catalogue
des MS. √©gypt.</span></span>, p. 132). It probably dates from the
epoch of the Ptolemies. It is in hieratic writing and generally
known by the name of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBook of Respirations‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBook of
the Breaths of Life,‚Äù</span> according to Mr. Le Page Renouf's ingenious
interpretation. This book seems to have been deposited
exclusively with the mummies of the priests and
priestesses of the god Ammon-RƒÅ, if we may judge from the
titles inserted into the manuscripts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Brugsch, in 1851, first directed the attention of Egyptologists
to this curious work, by publishing a transcription in
hieroglyphics of a hieratic text in the Berlin Museum, with a
Latin translation, under the title of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sha√Ø an Sinsin, sive liber
Metempsychosis</span></span>,‚Äù</span> etc. He added to this a copy of a hieratic
text of the same book found in Denon (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyage en Egypte</span></span>,‚Äù</span>
pl. 136).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A full analysis of this literary composition has also been
given by Dr. Samuel Birch, in his Introduction to the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhind
Papyri</span></span>,‚Äù</span> London, 1863.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Paris manuscript is as yet unpublished, but a copy of it
will be produced ere long by the present translator. A few
passages corrupted by the ancient scribe have been restored
from copies of the same text, which are in the Egyptian Museum
of the Louvre.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBook of Respirations‚Äù</span> has a great analogy with that
of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLamentations of Isis and Nephthys.‚Äù</span> It not only
makes allusion to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formul√¶</span></span> and acts by means of which the

thus greatly increasing our knowledge of the religious system
of the ancient Egyptians.

The commencement of the epic of Penta-our is wanting
in the papyrus, and the end is also defective, but
the date of the composition and the name of the writer
have fortunately escaped. It appears to have been written in
the ninth year of the King whose valor it celebrates. Champollion
saw this papyrus, and had formed some notion of the
nature of its contents, but to M. de Roug√© belongs the honor
of having first given a complete translation of it. This was
published in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revue Contemporaine</span></span>,‚Äù</span> 1856, p. 389. The
scene of the exploit lies in the neighborhood of the city of
Katesh,<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href="#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a> the capital of the Hittites, which stood on the banks
of a river named Anrata (or Aranta, as it is sometimes written),
perhaps the Syrian Orontes. It appears, from the sculptures
and inscriptions of Ibsamboul and the Theban Ramesseum,
that Rameses II, in the fifth year of his reign, made
an expedition into Asia to suppress a revolt of the Asiatic
tribes headed by the Prince of Heth. Arrived near Katesh,
upon the south side of the city, certain wandering Arabs came
to inform him that the forces of the Hittites had retired toward
the south, to the land of the Khirbou. These Arabs were,
however, in the service of the enemy, and were sent with the
intention of entrapping the Egyptians, the fact being that the
Hittites and their allies were assembled in force to the north
of the town. Rameses fell into the trap, and advanced to the
northwest of Katesh while the body of his army proceeded to
the south. Shortly after two Hittite spies were caught and
brought to the King, and under the pressure of the bastonnade,
confessed the true state of the affair. The prince of the
Hittites had in the meantime executed a movement to the
south of the city, and thus the King was cut off from the body
of his troops, and only escaped destruction by the dashing exploit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which his admiring subjects seem to have been never
weary of commemorating, and which furnished Penta-our, the
court poet, with a brilliant theme. A few extracts from the recital
shall be given, based upon M. de Roug√©'s version, from
which I venture in a few respects to deviate. The papyrus begins
in the middle of a sentence, at the moment when the King
had discovered his mistake.

The bowmen and the horsemen of his Majesty gave way before them.

Then was [fulfilled?] the saying of his Majesty. Then his Majesty, rising
up like the god Mentou [Mars], undertook to lead on the attack. He

O Amen. That which thou doest is dear to my heart[?] I cry to thee, my
father, Amen. I am in the midst of many unknown people gathered together
from all lands. But I am alone by myself; there is none other
with me. My bowmen and my horsemen have forsaken me; they were
afraid; not one of them listened when I cried to them. Amen is more
helpful to me than myriads of bowmen, than millions of horsemen, than
tens of thousands of chosen youths, though they be all gathered together
in one place. The arts of men prevail not, Amen is more powerful than
they; they follow not the commands of thy mouth, O sun! Have I not

This invocation is heard, and the King proceeds to make a
vigorous charge against the enemy, who are scattered in all
directions. The prince of the Hittites rallies, and succeeds in
bringing them again to the combat, but they are repulsed by
the King. It will be observed that sometimes the writer himself
speaks, but generally the narrative is put into the mouth
of the King‚Äîa poetical artifice which gives a certain liveliness

The battle is renewed the next day, and the Hittites are

of his arms in all the countries of the East.

At the end of the last page of the manuscript are the date
and dedication, unfortunately somewhat mutilated. The writer
Penta-our dedicates it, not to the King, but to a chief librarian,
probably Amen-em-an, with whom he carried on a correspondence.
This poem was so highly appreciated by the
King that he caused it to be engraved in hieroglyphics upon
the walls of one of his palaces, where some remains of it may
be still seen. If the date be correctly read, it would appear to
have been written four years after the event it celebrates, and,
notwithstanding the exaggerated style of adulation which pervades
it, there can be little doubt that some such occurrence
as that which it represents really took place.

these wars in the north we obtain light from the letters of Dusratta, King of
Mitani. He was a younger man than Amenophis III, and his sister married
the said King of Egypt. His daughter Tadukhipa married Amenophis IV, and
there were friendly relations with Egypt in the latter as well as in the former
reign. In his Hittite letter (<a href="#amarna_27_b" class="tei tei-ref">27 B.</a>) Dusratta
speaks of the boundaries of a region which seems to have been conceded
to him as his daughter's wedding-gift. He calls himself <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGreat Chief of the
Hittites,‚Äù</span> and the border was to run to Harran, Chalcis (south of Aleppo), and
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPh≈ìnician West.‚Äù</span> Thus Dusratta, who says in another letter (apparently
his first) that he has conquered the Hittites, would seem to have
swallowed up the Hittite King of Mer'ash and part, if not the whole, of
Aziru's country; and the Mongol populations were thus to be ruled from Armenia,
which was much nearer than Egypt. What became of the King of
Kadesh these letters do not say; but he was independent in later times, when
Seti I went up <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto conquer the city of Kadesh in the land of the Amorites‚Äù</span>
(Brugsch, Hist., ii. p. 15), and Kadesh was taken by Rameses II, the successor
of Seti I, after which a commercial treaty was made with Kheta Sar, the
King of Kadesh, whose daughter Rameses II married. There was thus,
perhaps, Hittite blood in the veins of the Pharaohs of the nineteenth dynasty.
In the treaty papyrus (see Chabas' <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVoyage,‚Äù</span> p. 336), it is mentioned that
the same terms‚Äîof equality‚Äîhad existed in the time of the writer's father and
grandfather that were claimed of Rameses II, and that war had occurred
later. This seems to show that Kadesh was independent shortly after the time
of the rebellion detailed in the Tell Amarna letters. The relations with the
Hittites were still friendly in the reign of Rameses III, when the Aryan hordes
from Asia Minor overran the Hittite country, and came down even to Egypt.
In David's time, the border between his kingdom and those of the Hittites
and Ph≈ìnicians was drawn from Hermon to Danjaan, south of Tyre (2 Sam.
xxiv. 6), and Solomon married Hittite princesses. The Hittite independence
was only finally destroyed about 700 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> by the

preceding. Neboyapiza's town Kamid, in Lebanon, was about sixty miles to the
northeast of Accho, and Ziza was perhaps his sister or daughter, married to
the king of an adjoining kingdom. The soldiers to be sent to Megiddo
would obtain news, perhaps, of his fate, from a force on its way to Yabis, in
Bashan, which his enemies reached after taking Damascus. Makdani is probably
the Megiddo of the Bible, on the way to Bashan, at the great ruin of
Mujedd'a, near Beis√¢n. The situation agrees with that of the city of Makta,
or Megiddo, mentioned by the Egyptian traveller near the Jordan fords
(Chabas, p. 207). The Magid‚Äî of the previous passage is probably another
spelling of the same name. The lady seems to have intended to go there
with a guard, and perhaps to obtain a detachment to go to Kamid. In the
lists of Thothmes III, Megiddo (Makdi) stands second, after Kadesh of the
Hittites; and it was at Megiddo that the chief victory of Thothmes was won.
It was then already a fortress which stood a siege, and was the key to the
road from Accho to Damascus. The form <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMakdani‚Äù</span> is explained by the
Megiddo of Zechariah (xii. II); and this final <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äún‚Äù</span> is represented by the

Hazor which Joshua took (Josh. xi. 1) from Jabin, which was above the

Hebron were never apparently disturbed by the chariots, and appear in these letters

the Sinaitic copper-mines were being worked, and before chariots came into

            originator of the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
